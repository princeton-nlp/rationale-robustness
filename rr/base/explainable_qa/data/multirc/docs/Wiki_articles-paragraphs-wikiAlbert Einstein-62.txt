Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics ( the very theory he helped create ) , despite its acceptance by other physicists , stating that God " is not playing at dice . "
Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory , and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76 .
In 1917 , at the height of his work on relativity , Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser .
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck 's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode .
This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws .
Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie 's work , and supported his ideas , which were received skeptically at first .
In another major paper from this era , Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves , which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton - Jacobi equation of mechanics .
This paper would inspire Schrodinger 's work of 1926 .
