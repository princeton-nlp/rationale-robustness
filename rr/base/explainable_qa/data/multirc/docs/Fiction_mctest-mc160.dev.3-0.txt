Greta ran to the corner with her older brother Tony .
He had money for the ice cream truck in his pocket and she was very happy .
The ice cream truck had been parked at the curb waiting for children for a very long time .
The ice cream truck driver thought that no more children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb when they got to the corner .
They yelled .
They screamed , " Stop !
Stop ! "
and jumped up and down on the side walk trying to get him to see them .
The driver of the truck saw them , waved at them and smiled , pulled back to the curb and opened his truck up so that they could see everything that he had for sale .
They were so excited .
They saw some new treats .
Tony wanted to try something new .
He got an ice cream sundae with chocolate ice cream and nuts .
He almost got a snow cone .
Greta looked at everything that the ice cream truck had .
She saw candy , ice cream cones , snow cones , and everything else .
It all looked so good .
But after looking at everything , she wanted to get an ice cream sandwich .
She got the ice cream sandwich .
She bit into it and smiled .
It tasted so good .
She felt so happy .
Her brother , Tony , was happy too .
He bit into his ice cream cone sundae and grinned .
They walked home with their ice cream and told their mom about how close they came to not getting their ice cream at all .
Their mom was happy that the truck had stopped for them .
She said that they were very lucky to have gotten to the curb before the ice cream truck left .
