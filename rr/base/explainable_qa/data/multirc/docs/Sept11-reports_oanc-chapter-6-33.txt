The Principals Committee had its first meeting on al Qaeda on September 4 .
On the day of the meeting , Clarke sent Rice an impassioned personal note .
He criticized U.S. counterterrorism efforts past and present .
The " real question " before the principals , he wrote , was " are we serious about dealing with the al Qida threat ?
Is al Qida a big deal ?
Decision makers should imagine themselves on a future day when the CSG has not succeeded in stopping al Qida attacks and hundreds of Americans lay dead in several countries , including the US , " Clarke wrote .
" What would those decision makers wish that they had done earlier ?
That future day could happen at any time . "
Clarke then turned to the Cole . "
The fact that the USS Cole was attacked during the last Administration does not absolve us of responding for the attack , " he wrote .
" Many in al Qida and the Taliban may have drawn the wrong lesson from the Cole : that they can kill Americans without there being a US response , without there being a price . "
