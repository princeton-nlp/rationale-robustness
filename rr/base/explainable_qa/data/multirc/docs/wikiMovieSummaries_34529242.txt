One evening , Felix serves as a conductor to four singing cats .
Meanwhile at a house only a few yards away , a hefty man is napping on a chair but gets awakened by their act .
To silence them , the man grabs and rolls out bowling ball , knocking Felix and the other cats off their feet .
Felix , however , still insist to go on performing as he plays a flute and his friends dance .
Awakened once more , the man takes out an ether sprayer and showers its contents onto the cats .
While his friends fall into a snooze , Felix decides to have his sleep at home .
Felix enters his apartment , and lies on the sofa .
But before he can rest long enough , his dwarf master calls him over .
Felix comes in and hears about the dwarf 's complaint about an insomnia problem .
To assist his master , the cat offers a glass of warm milk but to no effect .
The dwarf is still unable to sleep , and therefore craves for some entertainment instead .
Felix then plays a clarinet , and the toy soldiers start dancing to his music .
After moving around for a few moments , one of the little soldiers fires a small cannon , piercing a picture on a wall with its projectile .
The dwarf was amazed by the presentation , and asks Felix to handover the cannon .
When Felix gives it and suddenly turns around , the hostile dwarf aims the small weapon at him and fires .
Felix was struck at the back and frightenedly flees the apartment .
Out in the streets , Felix looks for suitable resting places .
He then climbs up a telephone pole , and lies down on a set of pants hanging on one of the lines .
