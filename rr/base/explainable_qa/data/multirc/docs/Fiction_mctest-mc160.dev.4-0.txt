My parents , Kelly and Kelley , said that it was that time of year to take a family vacation .
We 've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools .
This year my parents wanted to do something different .
They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle .
After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip .
My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the long car ride there .
Once we arrive , the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined .
There was so much to see and so much to do .
There was a swimming pool , movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor .
What a magical place !
I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family !
We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places .
There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets .
My brother , Kelsey , and I played hide and go seek for hours , watched movies and swam until the sun went down .
It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories .
We 'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle !
