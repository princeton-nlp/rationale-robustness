Spring 1944 .
Nazi officers want to organize a football match for Hitler 's birthday , in Which Germans would play against Hungarian prisoners of war .
They call for the famous Hungarian footballer , n di , and order him to organize a team .
n di accepts , but in turn demands extra food , a ball with Which he and his team can train before the match , and asks that they be allowed to concentrate on training before the match and not work .
The Germans accept all the demands , but recommend n di not include any Jews in his team .
However , n di ca n't organize the team only from his company , because only 8 out of 98 soldiers can play football .
Therefore n di recruits players from the other company .
One of the players is Steiner , who is a Jew and ca n't play football .
He lied to n di because he was afraid to die .
During training the footballers subdue the German corporal guarding them and try to escape .
They are soon recaptured and told they will now face probable death penalty .
However , the Germans order the Hungarian team to still play the match .
At the beginning of the match n di and his team are discouraged , as the Germans easily score three goals .
The Hungarians succeed in scoring one goal and the first half ends 3 - 1 in favor of Germany .
At the interval the German commander tells the Hungarians that they might not be executed if they lose the match .
The Hungarians refuse to believe this .
At the beginning of the second half they score three goals .
As a result , during the match , they are executed by the Germans .
