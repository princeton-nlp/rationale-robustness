Eric , a young boy , is excited about his birthday after reading a book and believes that a train will come for him , despite his sister Jill 's disbelief .
A few hours later , the train station 's control tower wakes up and in the roundhouse , Tillie , a young little blue switcher engine , along with her best bird friend , Chip , wakes up four other trains : Georgia , a kind all - purpose engine , Farnsworth , a stuck - up passenger engine , Jebediah , a worn - out old engine , and Pete , a gruff , burly freight engine .
After the tower assigns Farnsworth and Pete their jobs , Tillie tries to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah , but the tower insists that she is too small for the job .
Georgia is assigned to pull the birthday train .
A clown named Rollo leads the toys into the train , including Stretch , a basketball player ; Missy , a ballerina ; a Handy Pandy , a panda ; Perky , an elephant ; and Grumpella , a stuffed bird .
During her journey , Georgia breaks down and is taken back to the roundhouse by Doc .
Left behind , Rollo eventually takes Doc 's advice of flagging down one of the other engines returning from their daily runs over the mountain .
Farnsworth and Pete turn down their offers to pull the train .
Meanwhile , Tillie asks the tower to rescue the stranded train , but he insists that Tillie will never do the job .
Jebediah turns down his offer to pull the train because of his age , and returns to the roundhouse .
Chip and Tillie sneak past the sleeping tower and pulls the birthday train up a mountain .
