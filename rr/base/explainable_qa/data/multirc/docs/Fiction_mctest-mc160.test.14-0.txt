It is almost summer time .
Spring has been very long and very rainy .
Winter was very warm and very long .
In the winter the snows falls on the ground .
It covers all the grass .
It covers all the trees .
It covers all the flowers .
In the winter , the chipmunk goes to sleep .
The chipmunk works all summer long to gather enough food for the winter .
The chipmunk gathers berries .
The chipmunk gathers pine cones .
The chipmunk drops the pine cones off our roof and rolls them to her favorite hiding place .
Boom !
Boom !
Boom !
The pine cones sound so loud when they drop off the roof !
The snow melts away in the spring .
It is off the ground in our yard by the month of May.
In June , there is still snow on the mountains .
The snow on the mountains is still there until July .
In May the grass starts to grow .
In June , the flowers bloom again .
In July , we go swimming in the lake .
We get to play all summer .
We do not have to go to school .
We do not have to gather pine cones for food .
We get to play outside and we get to have cook outs .
We are not chipmunks .
We are children .
Our mom makes us lemonade in the summer time .
Our mom takes us to the beach .
Our mom lets us have a lot of campfires .
Our mom mows the lawn .
It is summer time and now we play for 90 days and the chipmunk works for 90 days .
In the winter we work and go to school and the chipmunk gets to sleep .
I am glad it is summer and I am glad that I am a human child and not a chipmunk .
I am glad that we get to be awake through all the seasons .
I like spring .
I like fall .
I like winter .
My favorite time of all is , for sure , summer !
