Joe 's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows , chickens , and ducks .
Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on .
One day , Joe 's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field .
His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself .
Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows .
When he was done , he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near .
He knew that climbing on the tractor would n't hurt anything , so he did .
He climbed on to the seat and sat there .
Then , he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor .
Joe 's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him .
Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast .
When he did that , he fell off and hurt his arm .
Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that .
Joe looked at his father and said , " I wanted to be like you . "
Joe 's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor .
Joe did and after he got a bandage on his arm , he and his father rode in the field on the tractor .
