Every Monday morning , the little bad boy named Josh goes to school .
Suddenly , little Josh slips on a banana skin ... - Ouch , says Josh , I fell on this and in addition I got a bump on the forehead !
- Wonderful !
said the banana peel .
I am Mary .
I turned into banana skin after throwing trash on the school yard .
You have saved me and now I 'm back to good old Mary .
What 's your name ?
- Mine is Josh ... I 'm a late to class ... are you serious , where is the banana peel anyways ?
- The Banana , my dear Josh , was eaten by me , I threw the banana peel and turned into one ... now you saved me , can you see the banana peel you slipped on around here ?
- No , you are right .
- Mary said : Josh , Thank you - Excuse me , Mary ... I have to go ... Otherwise I 'll be late for school ... And I would not want to upset the teacher .
