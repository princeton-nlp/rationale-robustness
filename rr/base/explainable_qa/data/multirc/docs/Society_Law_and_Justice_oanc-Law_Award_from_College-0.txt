Cathy Wallace did not always know what she wanted to be when she grew up .
She wanted to help people , but did not know exactly how .
A suggestion from friends sparked her interest .
" When I was in college , I thought I wanted to be a doctor , " she said .
" I found I did n't want to do that and realized an interest in psychology .
I did n't know what I wanted to do , but all my friends thought I should go into law because I was always on a soapbox .
I decided to try it . "
