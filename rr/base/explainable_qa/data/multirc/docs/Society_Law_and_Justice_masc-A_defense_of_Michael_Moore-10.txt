Taliban and American aid .
After the September 11 attacks , it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour .
Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001 .
Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation , but because of the Taliban 's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies .
Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords , it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage .
Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq 's Saddam Hussein .
Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal .
Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore 's website about the film .
Gun homicides .
Statistics are Moore 's weakest point , and it is surprising that his critics do n't dwell on them longer .
That 's because they know all too well that Moore is correct : The United States have a far greater homicide rate ( both gun- and non - gun ) than most other first world countries .
His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data , his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources ( and , as you correctly point out , he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries ) .
A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website .
