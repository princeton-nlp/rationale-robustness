The family across the street has a cat .
He is a cute black kitty named Dillon .
The cat is about two years old , and the family has had him for about a year .
He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside .
The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten .
Dillon jumps around , and chases flies , beetles and spiders .
When he plays with the children , he sometimes uses his paws to attack them , but he does n't try to hurt them with his claws .
Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem : he likes to eat bread .
The family only feeds him cat food , never human food like steak or potatoes .
But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can .
Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there , and tries to carry it away .
He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers .
The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns .
The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread .
They yell at him when he walks on the table .
But Dillon does not listen .
The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat .
The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook , and that 's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much !
