Shelly wanted a puppy .
She asked her mommy and daddy every day for one .
She told them that she would help take care of the puppy , if she could have one .
Her mommy and daddy talked it over and said that they would get Shelly a new puppy .
Her mommy took her to the dog pound so that she could choose one that she wanted .
All the puppies at the dog pound need a loving home .
Shelly went to every cage and looked each puppy in the eyes and talked to each one .
After each one , she told her mommy , " No , this is n't the one for me . "
Finally , she saw a black and white spotted one that she fell in love with .
She screamed , " Mommy , this is the one ! "
Her mommy asked the worker to take the puppy out so that Shelly could make sure .
Shelly and the puppy fell in love with each other right away .
Shelly and her mommy took the black and white spotted puppy home with them .
Shelly was so excited that she talked all the way home .
After thinking hard , Shelly had a name for her new puppy , Spot .
Now , Shelly has a new best friend and they play together every day when Shelly gets home from school .
