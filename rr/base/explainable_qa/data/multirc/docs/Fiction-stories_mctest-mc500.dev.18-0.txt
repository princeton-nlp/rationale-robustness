Tommy and Suzy ( brother and sister ) went to the playground one afternoon with their mom and dad , Jan and Dean .
They were playing a game of tag and having the best time ever running after each other and laughing .
They liked to play tag instead of building sandcastles or swinging .
They liked tag because they liked to run .
They like to play hopscotch or jump rope but that day they wanted to play tag .
Other games are n't as fun .
They met Tony and Ally ( who are best friends ) and invited them to play tag too .
Tony and Ally like to play other games like hopscotch or jump rope but that day they joined the game of tag .
Making new friends is important .
Tony and Ally would rather make friends than play their favorite games .
