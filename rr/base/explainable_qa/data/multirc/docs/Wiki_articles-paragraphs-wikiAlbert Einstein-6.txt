Their second son , Eduard , was born in Zurich in July 1910 .
In 1914 , the couple separated ; Einstein moved to Berlin and his wife remained in Zurich with their sons .

Eduard , whom his father called " Tete " ( for petit ) , had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia .
His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods , including full - time after her death .
The marriage with Maric does not seem to have been very happy .
In letters revealed in 2015 , Einstein wrote to his early love , Marie Winteler , about his marriage and his still strong feelings for Marie .
In 1910 he wrote to her that " I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be " while his wife was pregnant with their second child .
Einstein spoke about a " misguided love " and a " missed life " regarding his love for Marie .
