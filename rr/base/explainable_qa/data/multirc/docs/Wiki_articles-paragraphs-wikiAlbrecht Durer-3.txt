Wanderjahre and marriage ( 1490 - 94 ) After completing his term of apprenticeship , Durer followed the common German custom of taking Wanderjahre -- in effect gap years --in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas ; Durer was to spend about four years away .
He left in 1490 , possibly to work under Martin Schongauer , the leading engraver of Northern Europe , but who died shortly before Durer 's arrival at Colmar in 1492 .
It is unclear where Durer travelled in the intervening period , though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands .
In Colmar , Durer was welcomed by Schongauer 's brothers , the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig .
In 1493 Durer went to Strasbourg , where he would have experienced the sculpture of Nikolaus Gerhaert .
Durer 's first painted self - portrait ( now in the Louvre ) was painted at this time , probably to be sent back to his fiancee in Nuremberg .
In early 1492 Durer travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer , the goldsmith Georg .
Very soon after his return to Nuremberg , on 7 July 1494 , at the age of 23 , Durer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence .
Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker ( and amateur harpist ) in the city .
However , no children resulted from the marriage .
