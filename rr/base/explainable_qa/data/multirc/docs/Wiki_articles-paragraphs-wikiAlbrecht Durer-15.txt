From 1512 , Maximilian I became Durer 's major patron .
His commissions included The Triumphal Arch , a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks , the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer 's translation of Horapollo 's Hieroglyphica .
The design program and explanations were devised by Johannes Stabius , the architectural design by the master builder and court - painter Jorg Kolderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae , with Durer as designer - in - chief .
The Arch was followed by " The Triumphal Procession " , the program of which was worked out in 1512 by Marx Treitz - Saurwein and includes woodcuts by Albrecht Altdorfer and Hans Springinklee , as well as Durer .
Durer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor 's printed Prayer - Book ; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography .
Durer 's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason , and the decoration was continued by artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Baldung .
Durer also made several portraits of the Emperor , including one shortly before Maximilian 's death in 1519 .
