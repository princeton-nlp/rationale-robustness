To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger , in July 1939 , a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe , Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs , which Einstein , a pacifist , said he had never considered .
He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter , with Szilard , to President Roosevelt , recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research .
A secret German facility , apparently the largest of the Third Reich , covering 75 acres in an underground complex , was being re - excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development .
The letter is believed to be " arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II " .
In addition to the letter , Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House 's Oval Office .
President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first .
As a result of Einstein 's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt , the U.S. entered the " race " to develop the bomb , drawing on its " immense material , financial , and scientific resources " to initiate the Manhattan Project .
It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II .
For Einstein , " war was a disease ... [ and ] he called for resistance to war . "
By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles .
In 1954 , a year before his death , Einstein said to his old friend , Linus Pauling , " I made one great mistake in my life -- when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made ; but there was some justification -- the danger that the Germans would make them ... "
