The law was written at a time when public housing complexes were under assault by drug - dealing gangs and politicians were pressured to take action .
Families can be removed for drug use by one member , whether the drug activity is in the home or somewhere else .
Under the Department of Housing and Urban Development ' enforcement program , tenants may not avoid eviction simply by claiming ignorance of the crime or an inability to stop it .
Carlos Sanchez , executive director of the Grand Rapids Housing Commission , believes the law can be effective if it 's applied with discretion .
The commission administers about 3,500 public housing units in the Grand Rapids area , including Creston Plaza .
" I think if it 's done with caution , it 's a tool that we desperately needed in our developments , " Sanchez said .
Sanchez said Grand Rapids does n't have the large - scale drug problems larger cities do -- and he wants to keep it that way .
" We 've done the best we can to keep it from being so drug - infested it becomes a war zone .
Once the development is taken over , it 's very difficult to take them back . "
Sanchez said the commission relies on police reports in deciding evictions , which he estimated at one or two a year .
Among those cases , according to Leslie Curry , litigation director of Western Michigan Legal Services , was that of a mother evicted from public housing about a year ago with several young children .
She was removed because her 17-year - old son was arrested selling drugs outside the apartment , Curry said .
That left her with the hardship of seeking a place she could afford for herself and her children , without the certainty she afford the rent .
" She did n't know about it , " Curry said of the drug deal .
" In Grand Rapids , subsidized housing is critical to people 's ability to maintain basic security in their lives . "
