Alexander 's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece , they were not immediately believed .
Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir , his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander 's death .
According to Diodorus , Alexander 's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom ; his laconic reply was " toi kratistoi"--"to the strongest " .
Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point , implying that this was an apocryphal story .
Diodorus , Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas , a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry , in front of witnesses , thereby nominating him .
Perdiccas initially did not claim power , instead suggesting that Roxane 's baby would be king , if male ; with himself , Craterus , Leonnatus , and Antipater as guardians .
However , the infantry , under the command of Meleager , rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion .
Instead , they supported Alexander 's half - brother Philip Arrhidaeus .
Eventually , the two sides reconciled , and after the birth of Alexander IV , he and Philip III were appointed joint kings , albeit in name only .
Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians , however .
The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power .
After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC , Macedonian unity collapsed , and 40 years of war between " The Successors " ( Diadochi ) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks : Ptolemaic Egypt , Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia , Attalid Anatolia , and Antigonid Macedon .
In the process , both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered .
