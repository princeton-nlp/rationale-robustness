Born in Moscow , Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen .
By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg , his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene .
After school , Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital , Saint Petersburg .
In 1820 he published his first long poem , Ruslan and Lyudmila , amidst much controversy about its subject and style .
Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals .
This angered the government , and led to his transfer from the capital ( 1820 ) .
He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea , then to Kamenka and Chisinau , where he became a Freemason .
