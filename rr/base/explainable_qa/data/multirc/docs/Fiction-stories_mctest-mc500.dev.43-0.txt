Once upon a time , there was a squirrel named Joey .
Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy .
Joey and Jimmy played silly games together , and were always laughing .
One day , Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie 's pond .
Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left .
He could n't find anything to eat except for pie !
Usually , Joey would eat cereal , fruit ( a pear ) , or oatmeal for breakfast .
After he ate , he and Jimmy went to the pond .
On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit .
They dove into the water and swam for several hours .
The sun was out , but the breeze was cold .
Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home .
Their fur was wet , and the breeze chilled them .
When they got home , they dried off , and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt .
Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots .
The two squirrels ate some food that Joey 's mom , Jasmine , made and went off to bed .
