Before the establishment of the People 's Republic , Albania 's illiteracy rate was as high as 85 % .
Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II .
When the People 's Republic was established in 1945 , the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy .
As part of a vast social campaign , anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn .
By 1955 , illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania 's adult population .
Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7 % ; the male literacy rate is 99.2 % and female literacy rate is 98.3 % .
With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas , the provision of education has undergone transformation as well .
The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania , having been founded in October 1957 .
