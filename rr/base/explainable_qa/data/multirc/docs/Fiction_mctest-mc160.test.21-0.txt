One day , Phoebe woke up and found that her house had been broken into .
Her front door was wide open .
She went into the living room and saw that her television set and stereo were missing .
She checked the kitchen , but did n't find anything missing there except for a clock .
Then she saw that her purse had been stolen too .
She called the police to report what had happened .
The police officer told her that there had been a lot of cases like this in her neighborhood lately , and they were looking for the criminals .
Phoebe went into her bedroom and started to cry .
She had no money to buy a new television set or stereo .
She was scared that the robbers might try to break into her house again .
She called her friend Mary and asked her what to do .
Mary told Phoebe to change her front door lock right away .
She said she knew a detective who could try to find the robber who had broken into her house .
Phoebe thanked Mary , and said she felt safe knowing that there was someone who could help her catch the robber so he would n't do it again .
