Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex .
They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze .
Bernard Dempsey Jr. , an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services , the group that represents the tenants , said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings .
" They were given three days to get their stuff out , and if they could n't get moved out in three days , their stuff was discarded , " Dempsey said .
" Alamo Hills just threw it out . "
Others , he said , lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze , which left 78 people temporarily homeless .
According to the lawsuit , the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security .
A spokesperson for PM One , the company that manages Alamo Hills , could not be reached for comment .
Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court , which handles civil claims of less than $ 25,000 .
" We 're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $ 3,000 on top of their out - of - pocket expenses for their lost stuff , " Dempsey said .
" They 're not looking to get rich off this .
A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly . "
Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex , although many are trying to find homes elsewhere .
" The new apartments ( they were provided ) were not in very good shape .
That 's actually one of the claims , " he said .
