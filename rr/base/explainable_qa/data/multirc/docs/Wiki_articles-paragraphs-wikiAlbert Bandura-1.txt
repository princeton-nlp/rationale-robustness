Early life Bandura was born in Mundare , in Alberta , a small town of roughly four hundred inhabitants , as the youngest child , and only son , in a family of six .
The limitations of education in a remote town such as this caused Bandura to become independent and self - motivated in terms of learning , and these primarily developed traits proved very helpful in his lengthy career .
Bandura is of Ukrainian and Polish descent .
Bandura 's parents were a key influence in encouraging him to seek ventures out of the small hamlet they resided in .
The summer after finishing high school , Bandura worked in the Yukon to protect the Alaska Highway against sinking .
Bandura later credited his work in the northern tundra as the origin of his interest in human psychopathology .
It was in this experience in the Yukon , where he was exposed to a subculture of drinking and gambling , which helped broaden his perspective and scope of views on life .
Bandura arrived in the US in 1949 and was naturalized in 1956 .
He married Virginia Varns ( 1921 - 2011 ) in 1952 , and they raised two daughters , Carol and Mary .
