In the period before World War II , the New York Times published a vignette in their " The Talk of the Town " feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain " that theory " .
He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries .
He told his inquirers " Pardon me , sorry !
Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein . "
Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels , films , plays , and works of music .
He is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent - minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated .
Time magazine 's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was " a cartoonist 's dream come true " .
