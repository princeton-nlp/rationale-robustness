Once upon a time there a little girl named Ana .
Ana was a smart girl .
Everyone in Ana 's school knew and liked her very much .
She had a big dream of becoming spelling bee winner .
Ana studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling .
Ana 's best friend would help her study every day after school .
By the time the spelling bee arrived Ana and her best friend were sure she would win .
There were ten students in the spelling bee .
This made Ana very nervous , but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew she could do it .
The spelling bee had five rounds and Ana made it through them all .
She was now in the finals .
During the final round James , the boy she was in the finals with , was given a really hard word and he spelled it wrong .
All Ana had to do was spell this last word and she would be the winner .
Ana stepped to the microphone , thought really hard and spelled the word .
She waited and finally her teacher said " That is correct " .
Ana had won the spelling bee .
Ana was so happy .
She won a trophy .
Ana also won a big yellow ribbon .
The whole school was also happy , and everyone clapped for her .
The whole school went outside .
They had a picnic to celebrate Ana winning .
