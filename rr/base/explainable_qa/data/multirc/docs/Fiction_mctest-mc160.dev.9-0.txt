Peter was a very sad puppy .
He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time .
In fact , he had been there for three months !
Peter had seen many other puppies find a person ; he began to wonder why he could not get one .
He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough .
He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store , but they all picked smaller puppies .
However , one day all of this changed .
Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy .
She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with .
It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day .
Sammie came to hold him .
Peter wanted to show off his bark , but he was too tired .
He fell right to sleep .
Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms .
Sammie took Peter home that day , and they made lots of fun memories .
