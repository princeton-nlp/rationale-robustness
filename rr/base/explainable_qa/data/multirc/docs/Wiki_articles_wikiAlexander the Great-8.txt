As Philip marched south , his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea , Boeotia .
During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea , Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left , accompanied by a group of Philip 's trusted generals .
According to the ancient sources , the two sides fought bitterly for some time .
Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat , counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow , thus breaking their line .
Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines , followed by Philip 's generals .
Having damaged the enemy 's cohesion , Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them .
With the Athenians lost , the Thebans were surrounded .
Left to fight alone , they were defeated .
After the victory at Chaeronea , Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese , welcomed by all cities ; however , when they reached Sparta , they were refused , but did not resort to war .
At Corinth , Philip established a " Hellenic Alliance " ( modeled on the old anti - Persian alliance of the Greco - Persian Wars ) , which included most Greek city - states except Sparta .
Philip was then named Hegemon ( often translated as " Supreme Commander " ) of this league ( known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth ) , and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire .
