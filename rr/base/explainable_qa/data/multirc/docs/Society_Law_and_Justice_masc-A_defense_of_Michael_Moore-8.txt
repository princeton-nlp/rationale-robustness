Animated history of the US .
Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified , and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film .
But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely : That the strategy to promote " gun rights " for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish .
Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people ?
I highly doubt it .
But if they did n't , one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK .
This is the key message of this part of the animation , which is again being ignored by its critics .
Buell shooting in Flint .
You write : " Fact : The little boy was the class thug , already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil , and had fought with Kayla the day before " .
This characterization of a six - year - old as a pencil - stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore 's film warns against .
It is the typical right - wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset .
The kid was a little bastard , and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed .
But why do people deal with drugs ?
Because it 's so much fun to do so ?
It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American " contras " It is equally well known that the so - called " war on drugs " begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population ( both in relative and absolute numbers ) .
