One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift $ 25.6 million from funding for court - appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society .
In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities , the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law .
The Council document also noted that " inexplicably " 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City , even though their mandate is to handle only multi - defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict .
In past years , the City Council had consistently added $ 5.6 million to the $ 54.7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani , bringing the total to just a shade over $ 60 million .
But this year for the first time , the Council is proposing shifting more than $ 20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society , which would increase its total funding to $ 80.4 million .
That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one - third .
Meantime , the City Council proposed slashing the Mayor 's allocation of $ 62.8 million for 18-B lawyers by 66 percent , to $ 21.4 million .
