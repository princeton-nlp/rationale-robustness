The documentary portrays a behind - the - scenes look at the poor state of Argentina 's civil aviation , and puts the blame on the Argentine Air Force .
The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General Juan Carlos Ongan a in 1966 .
The producer / director , Enrique Pi eyro , claims Argentina and Nigeria are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry .
Pi eyro , a former Argentine airline pilot , makes his case in the documentary using diagrams , 3D animations , interviews , hidden cameras in the control tower , and a few props .
For example , at one point he spills out a bag of plastic airplanes and equates it to the number of planes the air force has lost due to negligence .
The film is heavily based on the Austral L neas A reas Flight 2553 plane crash .
Enrique Pi eyro takes his camera , secretly , into the control tower of the Ministro Pistarini International Airport also - known - as Ezeiza , the international airport at Buenos Aires .
