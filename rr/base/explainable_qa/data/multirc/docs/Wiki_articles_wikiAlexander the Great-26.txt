When Alexander destroyed Tyre , most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated .
A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem : according to Josephus , Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel 's prophecy , presumably chapter 8 , which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire .
He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt .
However , Alexander met with resistance at Gaza .
The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill , requiring a siege .
When " his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible ... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt " .
After three unsuccessful assaults , the stronghold fell , but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound .
As in Tyre , men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery .
Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC , where he was regarded as a liberator .
He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert .
Henceforth , Alexander often referred to Zeus - Ammon as his true father , and after his death , currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity .
During his stay in Egypt , he founded Alexandria - by - Egypt , which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death .
