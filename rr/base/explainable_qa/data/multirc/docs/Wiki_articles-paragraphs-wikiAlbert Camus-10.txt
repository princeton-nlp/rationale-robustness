Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat , which published an underground newspaper of the same name .
This group worked against the Nazis , and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard .
Camus became the paper 's editor in 1943 .
He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre 's play , The Flies , in June 1943 .
When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944 , Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting .
Soon after the event on 6 August 1945 , he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States ' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima .
He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper .
After the war , Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint - Germain in Paris with Sartre and others .
He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought .
Although he leaned left , politically , his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre .
In 1949 , his tuberculosis returned , whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years .
In 1951 , he published The Rebel , a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism .
Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France , the book brought about the final split with Sartre .
The dour reception depressed Camus ; he began to translate plays .
Camus 's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd .
He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither , which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works , such as The Stranger and The Plague .
Despite his split from his " study partner " , Sartre , Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist .
He specifically rejected that label in his essay " Enigma " and elsewhere .
