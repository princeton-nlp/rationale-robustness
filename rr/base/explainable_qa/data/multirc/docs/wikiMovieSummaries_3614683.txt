Littlefoot 's grandfather one night tells the children a story about ` ` The Lone Dinosaur '' , a legendary longneck who once protected the Great Valley from the most ferocious sharptooth ever to live .
A fight ensued , which led to the Sharptooth 's death .
However , the sharptooth left ` ` The Lone Dinosaur '' with a scar slashed across his right eye .
Soon after the battle , a huge monolith that resembled a proud sauropod , having life - sized Sharptooth teeth arranged around his neck , came out of the ground during an earthquake .
The dinosaurs called it ` ` Saurus Rock '' .
The legend also states that if anyone damages the monolith , bad luck would descend upon the valley .
A few days later when the kids are playing , Littlefoot accidentally falls off a cliff .
Just before he hits the ground , a gruff Diplodocus rescues him .
This longneck introduces himself only as ` ` Doc '' and gives no knowledge of his history .
Littlefoot is intrigued by this newcomer , who is scarred across one eye and displays prior knowledge of the Great Valley 's topography .
For the preceding reasons , Littlefoot assumes that Doc is the Lone Dinosaur .
He tells his friends this , narrating an apparently extemporaneous legend to support his assumption .
Inspired , Cera 's infant nieces , the twins Dinah and Dana , go to Saurus Rock without anyone noticing .
Later when the friends are playing , they notice that Dinah and Dana are missing .
Recalling their talk of the day before , they go to Saurus Rock to find them .
