Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India , in the region of the relatively late - arising Greco - Bactrian Kingdom ( 250 BC-125 BC ) in modern Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Tajikistan and the Greco - Indian Kingdom ( 180 BC - 10 CE ) in modern Afghanistan and India .
There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian , and especially Buddhist culture .
The resulting syncretism known as Greco - Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco - Buddhist art .
These Greco - Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China , Sri Lanka , and the Mediterranean ( Greco - Buddhist monasticism ) .
The first figural portrayals of the Buddha , previously avoided by Buddhists , appeared at this time ; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo .
Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion : the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes , and some Mahayana ceremonial practices ( burning incense , gifts of flowers , and food placed on altars ) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks .
One Greek king , Menander I , probably became Buddhist , and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as ' Milinda ' .
The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences , where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD .
For example , Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco - Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern - day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long - standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth .
The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence .
