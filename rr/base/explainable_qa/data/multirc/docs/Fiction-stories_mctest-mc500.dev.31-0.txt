Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles .
He was black and white and had long floppy ears .
He also had very short legs , but really big paws .
Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles ' favorite game .
Toodles loved playing fetch .
One Saturday , Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there .
He ran all around the pond , barking at the ducks .
The ducks ignored him , and kept swimming .
Toodles was n't having it !
He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks , chasing around his new playmates .
One of the ducks , braver than the others , poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears !
Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear .
Soaking wet , he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better .
After that , whenever he would see a duck , Toodles would run the other way .
