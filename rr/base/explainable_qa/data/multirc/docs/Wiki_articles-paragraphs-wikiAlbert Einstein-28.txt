Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , which opened in 1925 , and was among its first Board of Governors .
Earlier , in 1921 , he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization , Chaim Weizmann , to help raise funds for the planned university .
He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs .
Among those , he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land .
That should be followed , he suggested , by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology , to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria , which he called an " evil " that was undermining a third of the country 's development .
Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute , to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic , for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments , was also important .
Chaim Weizmann later became Israel 's first president .
Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach , Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel , a mostly ceremonial post .
The offer was presented by Israel 's ambassador in Washington , Abba Eban , who explained that the offer " embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons " .
Einstein declined , and wrote in his response that he was " deeply moved " , and " at once saddened and ashamed " that he could not accept it .
