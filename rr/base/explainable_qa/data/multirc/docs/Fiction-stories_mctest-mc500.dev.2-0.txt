Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend .
She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color .
When her mom first made it , it was white .
The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night .
Marsha 's favorite dinner was spaghetti , which happened to be every Tuesday night .
On one Tuesday , a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor .
To Marsha , it looked like a stick man so she kept him .
She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went .
Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha 's mom told her to soak him in water every few days .
There were a couple times that the family dog , Mika , has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him !
So from now on , Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times .
During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket .
At night , she puts him under her pillow .
She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him .
