Dylan and Jez are two orphans who meet in their twenties and vow to achieve their shared childhood dream of living in a stately home .
In pursuit of this dream they spend their days living in a disused gas holder , spending as little money as possible and conning the upper classes out of their riches .
During one of their biggest cons , their lives are touched by Georgie , who needs money to save the Down 's syndrome foundation that her brother attends .
When a con goes wrong , the two find themselves in gaol to be released only after their entire fortune is rendered useless because of a recall of 50 notes .
It is down to an elaborate plan involving Dylan , Jez and Georgie , to break them out of gaol in order to save their dream .
The film , in essence , is part Ealing comedy , part underdog farce with a sequence of madcap adventures set against a striking soundtrack by contemporary Britpop artists .
Unlike straight rom - coms or mainstream comedies of the period Shooting Fish contained a generous blending of fact and fantasy .
