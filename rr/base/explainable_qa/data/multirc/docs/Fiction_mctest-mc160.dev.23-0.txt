One day Magneson took a walk in the park .
He passed some trees and a pond .
In the pond was a duck named George .
George 's wife was also in the pond .
Her name was Nancy .
Magneson walked over to the tree .
Nancy flew up into the tree .
She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree .
A few years before , the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy 's son .
He was knocked out , and the squirrel took him away .
He was never seen again .
Magneson asked what their son 's name was .
They said it was Leonard .
But Magneson was only making small talk .
He did n't believe the story about the killer squirrel .
Even if there was one , there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel .
He could also hide in the tall grass .
George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson would n't listen .
They flew away , singing a sad song .
A short time later , the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson .
No one ever saw Magneson again .
