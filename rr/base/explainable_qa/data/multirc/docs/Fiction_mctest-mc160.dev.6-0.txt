Roger was a grasshopper .
He loved to hop .
He hopped everywhere by himself .
One day when he was hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log .
The frog told him his name was Gilbert .
Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into anybody .
Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would make great friends .
The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something very strange .
In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad .
The spider was very sad because he did not have any friends .
Roger and Gilbert asked him why he did n't have any friends .
The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him .
Roger and Gilbert told him that he did n't look scary to them and that he could come along with them if he wanted .
So Sam the spider said yes , and the three of them began a life time friendship full of adventures .
