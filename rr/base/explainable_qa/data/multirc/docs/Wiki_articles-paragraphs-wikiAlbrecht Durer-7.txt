On his return to Nuremberg in 1495 , Durer opened his own workshop ( being married was a requirement for this ) .
Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms .
Durer 's father died in 1502 , and his mother died in 1513 .
His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints , mostly religious , but including secular scenes such as The Men 's Bath House ( ca .
1496 ) .
These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto , and far more complex and balanced in composition .
It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself ; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman .
However , his training in Wolgemut 's studio , which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut , evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce , and how to work with block cutters .
Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself , or glued a paper drawing to the block .
Either way , his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block .
