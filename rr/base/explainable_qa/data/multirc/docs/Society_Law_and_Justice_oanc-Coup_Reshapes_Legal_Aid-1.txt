A government - sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County 's federally funded legal aid community .
The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP - controlled Congress .
That era was capped in 1998 , when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179 .
To comply with the orders from their main funding source , a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech - savvy and button - down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll - free phone lines , self - help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice .
While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless , for others , it did not come easy .
And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government - funded legal services than Los Angeles County 's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima - based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County .
From his offices in Koreatown , Iwasaki , a soft - spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney , quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program , the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles .
The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order .
Today , the programs operate seamlessly , offering new innovations - including toll - free multilingual phone advisers , expanded hours for domestic - violence clinics , and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program .
The organization is Los Angeles ' largest government - funded group , with a budget of $ 11 million leveraged into $ 40 million in legal services to the poor .
