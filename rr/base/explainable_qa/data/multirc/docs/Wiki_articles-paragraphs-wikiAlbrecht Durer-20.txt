As for engravings , Durer 's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise .
The portraits include Cardinal - Elector Albert of Mainz ; Frederick the Wise , elector of Saxony ; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer ; Philipp Melanchthon , and Erasmus of Rotterdam .
For those of the Cardinal , Melanchthon , and Durer 's final major work , a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck , Durer depicted the sitters in profile , perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach .
Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education , Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer , whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images .
He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars .
Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime .
" The Four Books on Measurement " were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German , as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler .
The other , a work on city fortifications , was published in 1527 .
" The Four Books on Human Proportion " were published posthumously , shortly after his death in 1528 .
