For the past 20 years , attorney Richard M. Smith has helped senior citizens with their legal needs , free of charge .
But Smith , like many volunteers , does n't want any accolades .
" I 'm no saint , " the 80-year - old Tallahasseean said .
" I 'm just a country lawyer . "
His assistant , attorney Twyla Sketchley , sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed , " He is a saint . "
Every month , Smith visits the Smith Williams Center in the Bond community and the Wakulla County Senior Citizens Council building in Crawfordville to advise seniors on wills , power of attorney and other legal matters .
Smith practiced law for a living until 1982 .
Since then , he 's been semi - retired , devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy .
" I 'm getting unable to do much physically , but my brain has n't quit , " said Smith , who walks with a cane .
" And I 'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later . "
Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday .
Jackson , who said she was " over 60 , " needed help with estate planning .
" He 's not through with me yet ... but he 's done a real good job , " said Jackson , a retired state worker .
Over the years , Smith said , he 's helped clients with not only wills but also adoptions , divorces and even animal control cases .
" Someone 's cat was bit by a dog , as I recall , " he said .
Smith coordinates his volunteer lawyering through Legal Services of North Florida , a nonprofit organization serving low - income families and individuals .
" He 's such a fine , fine person , " said executive director Kris Knab .
Without him , " There would be a huge ( number ) of people who would go without assistance .
