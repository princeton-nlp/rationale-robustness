I am very hungry .
I look for my mother .
When is dinner ?
I ask .
Dinner is at six , my mother says .
What can we eat ?
I ask .
We can pick food from our garden , she says .
I help her pick corn , beans , and peas .
The corn is yellow and white .
The beans are small and brown .
The peas are green and round .
I put the beans in a basket .
I put the peas in a bowl .
Mother brings the corn .
We go inside .
I have dirty hands .
I wash my hands with soap and water .
The water is warm .
My hands are now clean .
Mother lets me stir the beans .
I fill a pot with water .
Mother puts the corn into the pot .
She puts the pot on the stove .
The water boils .
Mary is my sister .
Mary puts four plates on the table .
Each plate is blue .
We each eat two pieces of meat .
I eat more corn than Mary .
Mary eats more beans than our mother .
What did you learn today ?
Mary asks .
I can spell ten new words , I say .
Mary can only spell two words .
