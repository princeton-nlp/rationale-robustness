A married couple and their three young adult children , a son and two daughters , live in a large compound with a garden and a swimming pool .
A tall fence surrounds the property and the children have never been on the other side of it , for their parents have kept them unaware of the outside world , even of the existence of the telephone .
They are taught different meanings for everyday words .
For example , they are told that a ` ` zombie '' is ` ` a small yellow flower , '' and that ` ` sea '' is a chair .
The parents promise that each child will be ready to venture outside the compound once she or he has lost a dogtooth .
Although the children are told they have a brother just on the other side of the barrier , he never appears .
The only non - family member to come into the house is Christina , a young woman who works as a security guard at the father 's factory .
She is driven by the father to the compound traveling both ways blindfolded where she performs sexual favors for the son .
Dissatisfied with his preference for intercourse , Christina seeks oral sex from the elder daughter in exchange for a headband .
The elder daughter obliges but does not recognize the significance of performing cunnilingus .
Later , she gives the headband to her younger sister , in exchange for being licked on the shoulder , Which is marked by an unexplained scar .
The parents have tricked the children into believing that overhead planes are merely toys .
They allow the children to search for toy planes that they have planted on the grounds , and the child that finds the toy owns it .
