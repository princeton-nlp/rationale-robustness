Hannah and her friend Mary were bored .
They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do .
They petted the cat .
They drew pictures in Hannah 's notebook .
They snuck into Hannah 's mother 's closet to try on her shoes , but Hannah 's mother caught them .
She said , " You girls need something to do .
Let 's take a walk to the park ! "
Hannah and Mary looked at each other , and then jumped up and down happily .
" The park sounds great ! "
said Hannah .
" Let 's go ! "
cried Mary .
So Hannah 's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies , and they all set off to walk to the park .
They walked down the sidewalk , looking at all the interesting things along the way .
Mary spotted a squirrel .
Hannah saw a yellow bird .
Hannah 's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr. Smith 's house .
When they got to the park , Hannah 's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack .
Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time , and then sat down to eat their snacks .
When they finished , Hannah 's mother put the leftovers in a trash can .
As they walked back home , Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out quite well .
