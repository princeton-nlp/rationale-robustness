In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study ( in Princeton , New Jersey ) , noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany .
At the time , most American universities , including Harvard , Princeton and Yale , had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students , as a result of their Jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s .
Einstein was still undecided on his future .
He had offers from several European universities , including Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 , however in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship .
Einstein 's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955 .
He was one of the four first selected ( two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Godel ) at the new Institute , where he soon developed a close friendship with Godel .
The two would take long walks together discussing their work .
Bruria Kaufman , his assistant , later became a physicist .
During this period , Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully .
