Alexander II 's death caused a great setback for the reform movement .
One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament , or Duma , which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people .
In a matter of 48 hours , Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people .
Had he lived , Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor 's reign .
The first action Alexander III took after his father 's death was to tear up those plans .
A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905 , when Alexander II 's grandson , Nicholas II , commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905 .
The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia , and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II , whose death was witnessed first - hand by his son , Alexander III , and his grandson , Nicholas II , both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them .
Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups , creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people .
A series of anti - Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation , the May Laws , were yet another result .
Finally , the tsar 's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate " ' propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution . "
With construction starting in 1883 , the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander 's assassination and dedicated in his memory .
