The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah - To - Bey .
The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah - To - Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection .
Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried .
The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb .
They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud .
Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb .
He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo .
Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .
Meanwhile , after being placed in the Cairo Museum , the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud .
The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition , beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum .
One by one , those who assisted in removing the contents of the tomb to Cairo are eliminated by such grisly means as strangulation , being thrown out of windows , and having photographic acid thrown in their face .
