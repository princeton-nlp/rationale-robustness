" The impact of her interest and work on the provision of legal services in the state of California is immeasurable , " said Patricia Philips , senior of - counsel for Los Angeles ' Morrison & Foerster .
" Its value is felt every day by someone who would otherwise be floundering around in the legal system yet dealing with very serious problems . "
Zelon 's public - interest work has not gone unnoticed .
Several organizations that share her commitment to public service - including the National Legal Aid & Defender Association and the State Bar of California - have honored her .
Two years ago , Zelon received the Laurie D. Zelon Pro Bono Award , which had been named for her one year earlier by the Law Firm Pro Bono Project , which she 'd helped found .
" I did n't find out until I was standing in the great hall of the Supreme Court , surrounded by 300 people who were there , that the award had been named for me and was thereafter going to be given in my name .
It 's very hard to believe , for anyone who knows me well , but I was actually speechless for a period , " Zelon said .
Zelon faced one of the greatest challenges of her legal career , she said , when her appointment to the bench forced her to switch gears from civil litigation to criminal law .
" It was a steep learning curve for me , " she said .
" It 's a whole different set of processes .
The rules are different .
The case law is a whole body unto itself . "
Attorneys praise Zelon for her thorough understanding of the law .
" She 's extremely well - versed in the law , " Leon said .
" She 's very thorough in her research , " Wong said .
Of course , not all attorneys concur with every decision Zelon makes in court .
Some city attorneys disagree with her interpretation of evidentiary statutes when Zelon puts limits on their use of hearsay testimony .
But lawyers who have appeared before her say that they appreciate her intelligent interpretation of the law .
