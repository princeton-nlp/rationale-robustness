Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin ; IPA : [ aljI'ksandr sjI'rgjejIvjItc ' puskjIn ] ; 6 June [ O.S. 26 May ] 1799 - 10 February [ O.S. 29 January ] 1837 ) was a Russian author of the Romantic era who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature .
Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow .
His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal , who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon .
Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen , and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum .
While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar 's political police and unable to publish , Pushkin wrote his most famous play , the drama Boris Godunov .
His novel in verse , Eugene Onegin , was serialized between 1825 and 1832 .
Notoriously touchy about his honour , Pushkin fought as many as twenty - nine duels , and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges - Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes .
Pushkin had accused D'Anthes , a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet 's wife , Natalya Pushkina .
