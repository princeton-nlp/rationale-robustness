Hannah Harvey was a ten year old that had many friends in school .
She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer .
One day , Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her .
She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces .
Even Jackson , Hannah 's dog , was acting different .
Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange .
Hannah 's father , who was known as Pop , explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move .
Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal .
Then , Hannah 's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya .
Kenya , she explained , was a place in Africa and life would be very different there .
As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home , Hannah 's mother calmed her with a gentle touch .
Jackson began howling as Hannah cried , but was also calmed by Hannah 's mother .
Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes .
She did not know the next time she would be home .
She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend , Susan .
Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was , but promised to visit Hannah .
The next day , Hannah boarded a plane with her family .
At first , they thought that Jackson could not come with them .
However , Hannah worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come .
After he had them all , the airport said it was OK for Jackson to come !
The Harvey family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in Kenya .
