Alexander fled Macedon with his mother , dropping her off with her brother , King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona , capital of the Molossians .
He continued to Illyria , where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest , despite having defeated them in battle a few years before .
However , it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son .
Accordingly , Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend , Demaratus , who mediated between the two parties .
In the following year , the Persian satrap ( governor ) of Caria , Pixodarus , offered his eldest daughter to Alexander 's half - brother , Philip Arrhidaeus .
Olympias and several of Alexander 's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir .
Alexander reacted by sending an actor , Thessalus of Corinth , to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter 's hand to an illegitimate son , but instead to Alexander .
When Philip heard of this , he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian , explaining that he wanted a better bride for him .
Philip exiled four of Alexander 's friends , Harpalus , Nearchus , Ptolemy and Erigyius , and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains .
