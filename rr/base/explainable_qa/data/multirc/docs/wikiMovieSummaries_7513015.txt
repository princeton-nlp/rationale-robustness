In India to purchase some horses , British aristocrat , Lord Esketh and his wife , Edwina , come to the town of Ranchipur at the invitation of the elderly Maharani .
Their marriage is an unhappy one and Lord Esketh announces his intention to return to England and begin divorce proceedings .
The spoiled , insensitive Edwina scoffs at this .
She renews in Ranchipur an acquaintance with a former lover , Tom Ransome , now a dissolute alcoholic .
She also meets and attempts to seduce a distinguished Hindu physician , Dr. Rama Safti , a decent man who is the elderly Maharani 's personal choice to succeed her someday .
Safti at first resists , but ultimately succumbs to Edwina 's charms and falls hopelessly in love with her .
Lord Esketh becomes aware of this , but Safti saves him from a man - eating tiger during a safari .
Safti admits his love for Edwina to Lord Esketh , who is now sympathetic toward this good man 's plight .
Ransome feels the same way , warning Edwina to stay away from Safti , a friend he admires .
Edwina similarly falls into disfavor with the Maharani , who explains that Safti has been raised to lead a pure life and that Edwina is unworthy of him .
Ranchipur suddenly is ravaged by a natural disaster , an earthquake and flood .
Dr. Safti is so busy saving lives that he can not personally care for Edwina , who has fallen ill .
Ransome looks after her as well as for young Fern Simon , who has declared her love for him .
When a dam is exploded by dynamite and as a result the flood waters recede , it is Dr. Safti who reveals that Ransome is the one who risked his personal safety to save the people of Ranchipur .
