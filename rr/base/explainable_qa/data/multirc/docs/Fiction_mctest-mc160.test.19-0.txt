One day a young boy went to visit a toy store .
In the toy store the young boy found many fun toys .
One toy that the boy really liked was a small blue toy truck .
The small blue toy truck was a lot of fun to play with , and made a lot of funny noises .
The young boy played with the toy truck for a long time , and then another little boy showed up and began to play with a little red car .
The two boys ended up becoming friends and played with the toys for a long time .
They ended up becoming good friends and had many play dates together over the months ahead .
On one play date the two boys built a large tree house and called it the tree castle .
They played for hours in the tree castle and always found something fun to do when they played together .
They were glad that they met in the toy store and became life - long friends .
