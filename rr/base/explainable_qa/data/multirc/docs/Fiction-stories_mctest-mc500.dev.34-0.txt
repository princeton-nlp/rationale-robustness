Josie started planning her new garden in the winter .
She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area .
She looked through the seed magazines .
She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower .
She talked to a friend about her plans .
It seemed like the snow would never melt .
But Josie did n't have to wait for spring to get started .
Six weeks before the last frost , Josie planted seeds indoors .
The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow .
Finally spring arrived .
Each day , Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures .
Josie worked in her garden , digging the soil .
She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better .
When everything was ready , she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden .
The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow .
