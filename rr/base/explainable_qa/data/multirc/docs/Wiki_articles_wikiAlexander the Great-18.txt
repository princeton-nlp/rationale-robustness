Before crossing to Asia , Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders .
In the spring of 335 BC , he advanced to suppress several revolts .
Starting from Amphipolis , he traveled east into the country of the " Independent Thracians " ; and at Mount Haemus , the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights .
The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi , and defeated their army near the Lyginus river ( a tributary of the Danube ) .
Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube , encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore .
Crossing the river at night , he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish .
News then reached Alexander that Cleitus , King of Illyria , and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority .
Marching west into Illyria , Alexander defeated each in turn , forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops .
With these victories , he secured his northern frontier .
While Alexander campaigned north , the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again .
Alexander immediately headed south .
While the other cities again hesitated , Thebes decided to fight .
The Theban resistance was ineffective , and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities .
The end of Thebes cowed Athens , leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace .
Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign , leaving Antipater as regent .
