Appended to the last book , however , is a self - contained essay on aesthetics , which Durer worked on between 1512 and 1528 , and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning ' ideal beauty ' .
Durer rejected Alberti 's concept of an objective beauty , proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety .
Nonetheless , Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature , and that there were rules which ordered beauty , even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code .
In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ( ' Nutz ' ) , naive approval ( ' Wohlgefallen ' ) and the happy medium ( ' Mittelmass ' ) .
However , unlike Alberti and Leonardo , Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images .
Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528 , Durer 's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of ' selective inward synthesis ' .
In other words , that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things .
Durer 's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that " one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day , or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron , and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another 's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year .
