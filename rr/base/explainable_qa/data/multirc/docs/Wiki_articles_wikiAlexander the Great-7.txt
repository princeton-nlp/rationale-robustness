At age 16 , Alexander 's education under Aristotle ended .
Philip waged war against Byzantion , leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent .
During Philip 's absence , the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia .
Alexander responded quickly , driving them from their territory .
He colonized it with Greeks , and founded a city named Alexandropolis .
Upon Philip 's return , he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern Thrace .
Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus , Alexander is reported to have saved his father 's life .
Meanwhile , the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi , a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs .
Still occupied in Thrace , he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in Greece .
Concerned that other Greek states might intervene , Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead .
During this turmoil , the Illyrians invaded Macedonia , only to be repelled by Alexander .
Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC , and they marched south through Thermopylae , taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison .
They went on to occupy the city of Elatea , only a few days ' march from both Athens and Thebes .
The Athenians , led by Demosthenes , voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia .
Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes ' favor , but Athens won the contest .
Philip marched on Amphissa ( ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League ) , capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city 's surrender .
Philip then returned to Elatea , sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes , who both rejected it .
