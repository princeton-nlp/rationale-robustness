{ { Plot } } Tom plays pool in a deserted pool hall , pocketing two balls by lowdown means and then wakes Jerry up by shooting the 10-ball into the pocket where he is sleeping .
Jerry awakes just in time to avoid the 10-ball and is carried out to the ball return , where the 10 and the 13 smash the mouse between each other .
Jerry is mad and walks up through the pocket , first sees nothing , but after a few steps back to the pocket , he spots Tom perched behind it .
Jerry tries to jump into another corner pocket , but Tom aims a cue ball with so much force that it roll 's into the pocket , and spins back out of it and it rolls Jerry backwards to Tom , who has made a ramp with his cue stick for the mouse to slide up .
Jerry stops at the top of the stick and is then blown down by Tom , who then shoots a stream of balls to make the mouse flat .
The whole train rebounds back towards the cat and the balls stack up at Tom 's end of the table .
Tom shoots all the balls in succession with his cue , and then tries to shoot Jerry , but the mouse hangs onto the cue tip .
The cat , as if he were saying ` ` Have it your way '' , chalks up and shoots the 8-ball using Jerry .
The mouse drops off the cue tip and then is upended by the 8-ball rolling in circles , and Tom forces Jerry to jump through the ball rack as if he were a circus performer .
Tom then sets it on fire to add an additional level of torment , and when Jerry accomplishes this with poise , Tom discards the flaming rack and shoots the 8-ball across the table and back .
