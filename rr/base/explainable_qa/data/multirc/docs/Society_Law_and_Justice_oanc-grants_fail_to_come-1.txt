For most lawyers , full waiting rooms and appointments booked out to mid - July would equate to a lucrative law practice .
But Frank Smith drives a 6-year - old car with 140,000 miles on it , and paying his senior paralegal minimum wage the last few months has put him in the red .
Hoped - for federal grants haven"t come through , so he"s had to raise his rates .
As of last week he charges $ 50 an hour minimum instead of $ 25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation .
That"s in a lawyer"s market where fees range in the $ 150 to $ 250 an hour range in the Ogden area , and up to $ 400 an hour in the Salt Lake area .
Smith"s one - lawyer foundation basically helps the folks who have too much money to qualify for the federally funded Utah Legal Services , but not enough money to afford a lawyer .
