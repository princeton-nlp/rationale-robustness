The Venetian artist Jacopo de ' Barbari , whom Durer had met in Venice , visited Nuremberg in 1500 , and Durer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective , anatomy , and proportion from him .
De ' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew , so Durer began his own studies , which would become a lifelong preoccupation .
A series of extant drawings show Durer 's experiments in human proportion , leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve ( 1504 ) , which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces .
This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name .
Durer made large numbers of preparatory drawings , especially for his paintings and engravings , and many survive , most famously the Betende Hande ( English : Praying Hands , c.
1508 Albertina , Vienna ) , a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece .
He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour ( usually combined ) , including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals , including his Young Hare ( 1502 ) and the Great Piece of Turf ( 1503 , both also Albertina ) .
