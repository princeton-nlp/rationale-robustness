The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th century church official , whose casket has a box - shaped urn chained to it .
Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum , the last surviving member of the Three Mothers ; an ancient trio of powerful black witches .
In particular , the box contains a magic cloak that , when worn by Mater Lachrymarum , increases her powers significantly .
The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome , where Sarah Mandy , an American studying art restorationworks .
Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce , a single father who is away from the museum that night .
With help from the assistant curator , Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak , a dagger , and three statues representing the three witches .
Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts , the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum .
Sarah arrives too late to save her boss and starts to flee the museum .
Unfortunately , she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum 's familiar and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum .
Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son .
Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that , shortly after mailing the urn to him , he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma .
