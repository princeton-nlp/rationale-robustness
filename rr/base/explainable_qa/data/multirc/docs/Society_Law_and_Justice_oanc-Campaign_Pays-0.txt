Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders .
" Thousands of times a year , Idahoans are victims of domestic violence .
The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights , " Trout said Tuesday .
" This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis . "
The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than $ 35,000 from law firms , attorneys , corporations and individuals .
The goal is $ 100,000 .
The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months .
The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program .
Last year , more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases .
More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines .
Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida - West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill , members of the project 's executive committee .
Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence , but benefited from free legal services .
Last year 's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims .
The help ranged from representation in protection order hearings to legal assistance in divorce , visitation and child support cases .
The donations are tax deductible .
