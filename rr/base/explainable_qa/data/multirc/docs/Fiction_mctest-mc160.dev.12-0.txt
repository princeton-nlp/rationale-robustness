Three little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a great big cat to hide .
Their great big cat was named Cowboy .
And Cowboy was not a very nice cat .
Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things .
When Cowboy was happy , which was not very often , Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth .
When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds .
And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide .
Cowboy would hide , curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by .
When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them .
He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice .
Cowboy was only a cat .
A great big cat that did not know any better .
