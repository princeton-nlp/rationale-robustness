Boone , Ia.
-Poor and elderly people may soon go without legal representation in Boone County .
Boone County Legal Aid , which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who could n't afford them , will close in February if a $ 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded .
The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services .
" It is a very sad situation , but that 's the fact , " said Alan Schroeder , city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid .
For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county , Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone , taking on about 60 clients a year , and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy .
He also has a private practice .
If the legal service closes , he 's unsure where his clients will go .
The city of Boone gave Schroeder $ 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases , said Kathy Berg , Boone 's finance officer .
Without that , the program might already be closed .
" All governments are having problems with finances , " Boone Mayor George Maybee said .
" No one else stepped in .
The county did n't .
The state did n't . "
Donovan Olson , chairman of the county Board of Supervisors , said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county did n't need it .
Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester " for a variety of reasons , " Suzanne Levitt , the law professor who oversaw the program , said via e - mail .
Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money .
Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake , which had provided as much as two - thirds of the money in some years .
