The film starts with a shot of a spaceship flying through space .
El , a crew member , walks through the corridors of the ship when he discovers the eponymous magic portal , a rectangular arch flashing with various colors .
Entering the portal , he is transported into a world of passageways .
Some LEGO creatures appear and build a small car for him to drive through the world of passages .
He then has a close encounter with a two - headed monster who chases him through the various paths of the mysterious world .
After El 's car has a bump from a crossing train , the car falls apart .
El finds another portal , and nearly gets eaten by the monster , who ends up in the real world while chasing a leftover tyre from the devoured car and attacks Lindsay Fleay .
El reports his experiences to Captain Paranoia , but neither him nor his shipmate Pee believes him .
However , Captain Paranoia finds another Portal , Which takes him to a ` ` white expanse '' world , where a plasticine creature messes around with him , making him very annoyed and then flushs him out of the white colored world .
The plasticine creature then goes back through the portal Captain Paranoia came through .
The Captain then finds his way back to the ship , and tells El and Pee about what happened in the Portal .
El , Pee , Captain Paranoia and the Plasticine creature , go through the Portal , and find themselves in the real world , and get chased by liquid paper daleks .
The four escape the liquid paper daleks , Which are scared off by the two - headed monster that El had an encounter with earlier , in a shoe car .
