Former prosecutor Michael Mazzariello was finally doing the kind of legal work he 'd always dreamed of , but after less than a year of helping East New York 's poor , he 's getting booted from the bodega he turned into an office .
Nearly a year ago , Mazzariello , a former assistant district attorney who grew up in East New York , started a nonprofit practice helping the working poor navigate the legal system .
Immigration , landlord - tenant disputes and even criminal cases are the specialty of his East New York Legal Services Corp. on New Lots Ave . The office , in a former bodega , was Mazzariello 's idea , and he got some help from high places early on .
" I picked up the phone and called Rudy Giuliani on his radio program , " Mazzariello said .
" I said , ' Mr. Mayor , we 're interested in renting space in a building the city owns .
" I swear , within an hour , the building was ours .
We filled out all the paperwork .
We got the nonprofit status from the feds .
We were rolling . "
Refusing to charge clients , Mazzariello , 42 , said he used his family 's savings to sustain the office during the first year .
Already recognized as a federal nonprofit , the agency is awaiting state status that would allow it to survive on charitable donations .
" This is what I want to do - to give back to the community , " said Mazzariello , who worked under Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes from 1990 to 1993 , followed by a stint as the Board of Education 's chief prosecutor .
Under the city Housing Preservation and Development Department 's tenant ownership program , Mazzariello and partner Joe Guzzo learned they could rent to own .
They invested $ 8,500 in a new facade , rest room makeover and other modest improvements .
