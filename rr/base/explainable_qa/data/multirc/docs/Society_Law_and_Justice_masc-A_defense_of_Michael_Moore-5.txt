The rally took place on October 17 , the shooting on February 29 .
Again , standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion : " Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas .
It is brilliantly , if unethically , done . "
As noted above , the " from my cold dead hands " part is simply Moore 's way to introduce Heston .
Did anyone but Moore 's critics view it as anything else ?
He certainly does not " attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered " and , as noted above , doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is .
Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland , you write : " There is no indication that [ Heston ] recognized Kayla Rolland 's case . "
This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence .
Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview , he certainly knew about the case at that point .
Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase " 48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead " : This is one valid criticism , but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be ; rather , it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore 's fast pace editing .
The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there ( as will become quite obvious ) , but simply to highlight the first mention of the name " Kayla Rolland " in the text , which is in this paragraph .
