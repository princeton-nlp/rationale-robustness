That man , Fukuda , leads a peaceful life as a mirror maker under the name of Uncle Foo .
He has a young prot g e , however : Jay , a smug martial artist who constantly tries to prove himself by taking up every opportunity to fight .
Jay also constantly teases his lecherous servant Chee and takes few things very seriously .
However , as he sees his surrogate father attacked , Jay immediately rushes to his aid , but during several clashes he has to find out that he and the ninja are evenly matched .
Eventually , it is revealed that Jin Wu s father was not killed by his clan members ; he had died as a hero in a rebellion instead .
Ashamed of his own cowardice in escaping to China years before following that attempted uprising , Foo makes peace with Jin .
