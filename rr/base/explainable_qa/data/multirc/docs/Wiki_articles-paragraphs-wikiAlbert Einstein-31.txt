When he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart , whereupon " Einstein fell in love " with Mozart 's music and studied music more willingly .
He taught himself to play without " ever practicing systematically " , he said , deciding that " love is a better teacher than a sense of duty . "
At age 17 , he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played Beethoven 's violin sonatas , the examiner stating afterward that his playing was " remarkable and revealing of ' great insight ' . "
What struck the examiner , writes Botstein , was that Einstein " displayed a deep love of the music , a quality that was and remains in short supply .
Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student . "
Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein 's life from that period on .
Although the idea of becoming a professional himself was not on his mind at any time , among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals , and he performed for private audiences and friends .
Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern , Zurich , and Berlin , where he played with Max Planck and his son , among others .
He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Kochel catalogue of Mozart 's work ; that edition was actually prepared by Alfred Einstein .
In 1931 , while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology , he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles , where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart 's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet .
Near the end of his life , when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton , he played his violin with them , and the quartet was " impressed by Einstein 's level of coordination and intonation . "
