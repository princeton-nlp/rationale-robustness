FEMA inspectors were in Kerrville again Wednesday , inspecting some damaged homes .
According to Lindsay , FEMA has already received 44,000 inspection requests in Texas .
The number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday , bringing the total to 5,855 , he said .
FEMA has already distributed $ 1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing .
" The registration process is going rapidly , " Lindsay said , adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes .
Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross , but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them , too .
Daletta Andreas , Hill Country chapter executive director , said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services .
That 's incorrect , Andreas said .
" They need to come in and go through our interview process , " she said .
The Red Cross service center , 333 Earl Garrett St. , is open from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
daily , and will be open this weekend , Andreas said .
People seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area .
Members of the State Bar of Texas are offering free legal advice for flood victims .
Victims in Texas counties declared a federal disaster can call ( 800 ) 504 - 7030 for assistance with basic legal questions .
The free legal assistance hotline , operated in coordination with Texas Rural Legal Aid and volunteer lawyers from across the state , will be available from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m. , Monday through Thursday , and 8 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
