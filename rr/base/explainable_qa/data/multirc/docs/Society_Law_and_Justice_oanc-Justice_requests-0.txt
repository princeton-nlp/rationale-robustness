The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a $ 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases , Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday .
" Some might say , why should we support this when we face tough financial times ? "
Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature .
" It seems to me in America , where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law , we should not ration access to justice . "
The recommendation comes from the court 's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding , created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases .
As the task force was studying the issue , $ 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services .
That prompted the state 's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs , Alexander said .
The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to $ 200 .
The total fee would be split , with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account .
Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships , arguing that increased caseloads require more judges .
Two of the Superior Court judges and the District Court judge would be in Clark County , with one Superior Court judge added in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties and one each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties .
