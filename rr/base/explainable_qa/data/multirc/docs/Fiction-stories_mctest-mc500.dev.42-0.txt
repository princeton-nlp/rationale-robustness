John wanted to have a birthday party for his son , Mike .
John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns , as did their daughter Jane .
So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party .
When the clown arrived , ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show .
His parents had sent out 12 invites , thinking 6 or 8 kids would come .
The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John 's face .
This caused John 's face to turn red .
After the show , when everyone had left , it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party .
There was food everywhere ; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground .
Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat .
The choices were order a pizza , make hamburgers , go get fried chicken or make noodles .
Since it was Mike 's birthday they let him choose .
He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order .
When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas .
Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen .
John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner .
