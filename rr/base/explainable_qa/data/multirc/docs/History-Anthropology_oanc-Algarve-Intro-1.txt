For much of the world , the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal , yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite : the region has little in common with the rest of the country .
The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one .
It has no cosmopolitan cities , like Lisbon and Porto , which are farther north .
Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns , medieval castles , and grand palaces .
The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments , hotels , and meticulously manicured golf courses .
And beaches .
Think Algarve and the mind pictures long , glorious stretches of golden sands , secluded coves framed by odd ochre - colored rock formations , and deep green waters .
With about 160 km ( 100 miles ) of coastline , Portugal 's southern province is one of Europe 's premier beach destinations .
The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic , but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel .
Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal , and one of the kindest in the world : more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area .
The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter , and in late January and February , white almond blossoms blanket the fields .
In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable , and regardless , beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away .
Magnificent year - round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations .
Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding , tennis , big - game fishing , sailing , and windsurfing are immensely popular .
Sports , beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety .
But it 's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve ; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here .
The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east .
West is where you 'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks .
