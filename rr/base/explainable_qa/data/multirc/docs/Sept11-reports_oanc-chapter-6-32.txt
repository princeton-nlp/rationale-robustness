The CIA 's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well , problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize .
One ( which also applied to reconnaissance flights ) was money .
A Predator cost about $ 3 million .
If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes , it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force , but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down .
Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it ; the CIA disagreed .
Second , Tenet in particular questioned whether he , as Director of Central Intelligence , should operate an armed Predator . "
This was new ground,"he told us .
Tenet ticked off key questions : What is the chain of command ?
Who takes the shot ?
Are America 's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this , going outside of normal military command and control ?
Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA , he and the Agency 's executive director , A. B. " Buzzy " Krongard , had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger , but Tenet was appalled , telling them that they had no authority to do it , nor did he .
Third , the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work .
It had been built to hit tanks , not people .
It needed to be designed to explode in a different way , and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision .
In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001 , the Predator 's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle .
White House officials had seen the Predator video of the " man in white . "
On July 11 , Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system .
He directed McLaughlin , Wolfowitz , and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1 .
