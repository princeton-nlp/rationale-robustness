Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods .
This family had always lived in the woods .
Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town .
The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children .
The dad and his family had a good life .
They never wanted for much .
The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town .
One day there came a nasty storm to the woods .
This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city .
Many homes were under water .
The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back .
The logs would be used to build a wall .
The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find .
In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children .
