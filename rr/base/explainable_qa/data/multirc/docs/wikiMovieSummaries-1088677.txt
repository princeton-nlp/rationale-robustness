Mr. Neville ( ( ( Anthony Higgins , a young and arrogant artist and something of a Byronic hero , is contracted to produce a series of 12 landscape drawings of an estate by Mrs. Virginia Herbert for her absent and estranged husband .
Part of the contract is that Mrs. Herbert agrees ` ` to meet Mr. Neville in private and to comply with his requests concerning his pleasure with me . ''
Several sexual encounters between them follow , each of them acted in such a way as to emphasise reluctance or distress on the part of Mrs Herbert and sexual aggression or insensitivity on the part of Mr Neville .
Meanwhile , whilst living on the estate , Mr. Neville gains quite a reputation with its dwellers , especially with Mrs. Herbert 's son - in - law , Mr. Talmann .
Mrs. Herbert , wearied of meeting Mr. Neville for his pleasure , tries to terminate the contract before all of the drawings are completed and orders Mr. Neville to stop .
But he refuses to void the contract and continues as before .
Then Mrs. Herbert 's married , but as yet childless , daughter , Mrs. Talmann , who has apparently become attracted to Mr. Neville , seems to blackmail him into making a second contract in Which he agrees to comply with what is described as her pleasure , rather than his a reversal of the position in regard to her mother .
A number of curious objects appear in Neville 's drawings , Which point ultimately to the murder of Mr. Herbert , whose body is discovered in the moat of the house .
Mr. Neville completes his twelve drawings and leaves the house .
