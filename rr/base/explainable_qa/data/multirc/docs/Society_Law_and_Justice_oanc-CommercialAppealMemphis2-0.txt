Thelma James was a prime candidate for a real estate ripoff : She is 68 , has precious little money and ca n't read or write .
" I wo n't lie to you .
I was so - o - o excited , " the widow and former duplex dweller said of the purchase of her first home , a sagging frame structure on Snowden .
" I was glad to get me a house . "
When James realized she had been swindled she turned to Memphis Area Legal Services , which represented her in a lawsuit .
Now , James 's monthly house notes have dropped from $ 796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable $ 247 .
Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail .
" I do n't know what I would have done without Legal Services , " said James .
" They solved a lot of my problems . "
James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS , which provides assistance for civil matters , such as domestic abuse and family - related problems , Social Security and Supplemental Security Income , veterans , housing and consumer fraud cases .
Like James , most clients are elderly or female .
Some are handicapped .
Some need medical care or veteran 's benefits .
Some are trying to escape eviction or an abusive marriage .
And 87 percent live at or below poverty level .
Shelby County Mayor A C Wharton recently said Legal Services is important for those who , because of poverty or other struggles in life , think justice is an empty word .
" They must be given reason to believe that the law is for them too , " said Wharton , a former executive director of MALS .
But MALS faces a funding crunch next year , brought on by a $ 200,000 shortfall from three revenue sources .
