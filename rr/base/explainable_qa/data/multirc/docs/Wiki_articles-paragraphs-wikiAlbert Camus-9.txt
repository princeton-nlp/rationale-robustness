The driver of the Facel Vega car , Michel Gallimard , who was Camus 's publisher and close friend , also died in the accident .
In August 2011 , the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot , but Camus 's biographer , Olivier Todd , did not consider it credible .
Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery , Lourmarin , Vaucluse , France .
He was the second - youngest recipient , at the age of 44 , of the Nobel Prize in Literature , after Rudyard Kipling , at the age of 42 .
He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter , Jean and Catherine , who hold the copyrights to his work .
Two of Camus 's works were published posthumously .
The first , entitled A Happy Death ( 1970 ) , featured a character named Patrice Mersault , comparable to The Stranger 's Meursault .
There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books .
The second was an unfinished novel , The First Man ( 1995 ) , which Camus was writing before he died .
The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria .
