F. Dianne Taylor is executive director of Legal Services of Eastern Missouri .
We 're all familiar with the Miranda warning , or at least how it sounds in the movies .
It includes the statement : " You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning .
If you can not afford a lawyer , one will be provided for you at government expense . "
The Miranda warning , though , applies only to criminal cases .
What about the less theatrical , but equally troubling , civil problems that can afflict people in any walk of life ?
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has estimated that four out of every five low - income people in America who need legal representation do n't receive it .
That is a sobering observation , to realize that 80 percent of those who need legal help are denied such guidance and counsel .
Who are these people ?
They may be victims of domestic abuse .
Perhaps they are elderly people who are swindled out of their life savings or beaten by a neighbor or acquaintance .
Maybe they are homeless children who ca n't attend school because they are n't officially residents of a district .
They are our neighbors , our friends , our colleagues .
Facing eviction or physical assault or bankruptcy without legal assistance can be every bit as frightening as standing trial on a criminal charge .
Issues in civil cases include family matters , housing and employment cases , consumer protection , public benefits and income maintenance .
In the year 2000 alone , Legal Services of Eastern Missouri fielded some 30,000 calls for assistance from low - income people in the 21 counties our not - for - profit organization represents .
By contrast , approximately 6,500 cases were closed by the organization last year .
More than 312,000 people in the eastern Missouri counties stretching from the Iowa border to Jefferson County qualify for legal aid , an increase of more than 10 percent from 1990 .
