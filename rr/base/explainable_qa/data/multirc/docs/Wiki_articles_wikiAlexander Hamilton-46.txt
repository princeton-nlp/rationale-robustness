The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr. , which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan .
He named the house , which was completed in 1802 , the " Grange " after his grandfather Alexander 's estate in Ayrshire , Scotland .
The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis , a British born real estate developer , for $ 25,000 .
Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis ( Hamilton - Holly House ) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander .
The Grange , first moved from its original location in 1889 , was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate , in Hamilton Heights , a neighborhood in upper Manhattan .
The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011 , and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial .
Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton - Oneida Academy in New York state .
Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812 , and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College . Columbia University , Hamilton 's alma mater , has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City .
The college 's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall , and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it .
The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition .
Columbia University 's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society .
