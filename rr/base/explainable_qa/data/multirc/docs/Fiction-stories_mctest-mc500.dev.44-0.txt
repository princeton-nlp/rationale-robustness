Jake was walking to the park to play baseball with his friends .
He loved being outside on sunny days , and now that school was over for the year , he was playing baseball every day .
The more he played , the better he got .
Only Frank was better than he was .
He liked playing third base , but he often played in the field .
He was carrying his favorite mitt that his Grandfather had bought him .
His Grandfather had taught him to catch .
He loved spending time with him when he was younger , but he had moved last year .
Now he only saw his Grandfather in the summer .
Jake was really excited to show him his skills when he came to their next game .
He could throw really fast now .
He was sure his Grandfather would want to sit in the front to watch him .
He knew he would jump up and down .
Jake happily ran the rest of the way to the park thinking about how much fun he was going to have playing baseball this year .
