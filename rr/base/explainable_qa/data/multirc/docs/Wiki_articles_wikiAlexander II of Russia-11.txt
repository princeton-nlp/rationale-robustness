In 1863 , Alexander II re - convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland 's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency , the markka .
Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development .
Finland also got its first railways , separately established under Finnish administration .
Finally , the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society .
Alexander II is still regarded as " The Good Tsar " in Finland .
These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated , homogeneous country , than in the whole of Russia .
They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western - oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising .
Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden .
