Once upon a time Jimmy had a mother who told him that he was good at music .
Jimmy wanted to play music .
He did not know which instrument to play , so he tried a piano first .
The piano went like a sound .
Then he tried a guitar .
The guitar played .
His brother told him that the piano was better to start , so Jimmy played the piano .
He hammered on the keys .
Jimmy 's brother liked this , but mom did not like this .
Jimmy tried playing very quiet .
Jimmy 's mom liked this , but Jimmy 's brother did not like this .
Jimmy tried playing in the middle .
Jimmy liked this , and Jimmy 's mom liked this , and Jimmy 's brother liked this .
It was great .
