He also promises to ` ` come to '' him .
That night , in what is seemingly a dream , Victor visits Louis , warning him about the burial ground beyond the pet cemetery .
Louis wakes up to find his feet covered in dirt .

He attacks Louis and reeks of decomposition .
Louis asks if a person was ever buried in the grounds .

And whoever would ? ''
