His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498 , as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon .
He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year , and a little later , a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints .
The Seven Sorrows Polyptych , commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496 , was executed by Durer and his assistants c.
Around 1503 - 1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin , which he did not finish for some years .
Neither these , nor the Great Passion , were published as sets until several years later , but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers .
During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings .
It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father , as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith .
In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son , which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later , noting its Germanic quality .
He was soon producing some spectacular and original images , notably Nemesis ( 1502 ) , The Sea Monster ( 1498 ) , and Saint Eustace ( c.
1501 ) , with a highly detailed landscape background and animals .
His landscapes of this period , such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill , are quite different from his earlier watercolours .
There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere , rather than depicting topography .
He made a number of Madonnas , single religious figures , and small scenes with comic peasant figures .
Prints are highly portable and these works made Durer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years .
