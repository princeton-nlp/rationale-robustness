One day Kyle 's Dad had to go for a long ride .
He went on this ride because he wanted to get breakfast .
With breakfast the dad always loved to get a banana in a drink .
This was his favorite drink .
But along the ride , Kyle 's dad had a scare .
The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book .
Later he found his book in a white bin .
Along with the book , there was a white costume .
He thought that maybe this was a sign .
So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume .
He remembered that his son Kyle 's favorite thing to do was play doctor .
This made him remember that he never even asked his son Kyle if he wanted to come for the ride .
So the dad turned around and drove all the way home to get his son .
He asked Kyle if he wanted to come out to breakfast .
Kyle got very excited and said he did .
Kyle 's dad was happy he came back because it helped him make his son happy .
