Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by .
But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County .
This month , the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two - year , $ 350,000 grant to the Women 's Haven of Tarrant County .
The money will allow the shelter to add a second full - time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services .
Most important , the funds will help fill a frustrating gap .
The Women 's Haven , which provides shelter and outreach to domestic - violence victims , already has a full - time attorney .
But that person is prohibited ( by funding parameters ) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody .
That 's not a problem for most of the shelter 's indigent residents , who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services .
But many of the clients served by the Women 's Haven outreach programs are the working poor , who do n't qualify for free legal services .
Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach .
" They ca n't begin to save up enough money for a divorce , so they 're stuck , " says Sonyia Hartwell , the Women 's Haven 's associate director .
" They 're completely shut out of the civil - law system . "
In Texas , unlike in some other states , women who are n't divorced ca n't gain full control over their portion of assets .
And they ca n't obtain child support .
The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases .
" They ca n't go to court , but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done " as well as investigative work , says Hartwell .
And there 's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help .
" Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle , " says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney , " we 'll have an active caseload of 20 or more . "
