Susan wanted to have a birthday party .
She called all of her friends .
She has five friends .
Her mom said that Susan can invite them all to the party .
Her first friend could not go to the party because she was sick .
Her second friend was going out of town .
Her third friend was not so sure if her parents would let her .
The fourth friend said maybe .
The fifth friend could go to the party for sure .
Susan was a little sad .
On the day of the party , all five friends showed up .
Each friend had a present for Susan .
Susan was happy and sent each friend a thank you card the next week .
