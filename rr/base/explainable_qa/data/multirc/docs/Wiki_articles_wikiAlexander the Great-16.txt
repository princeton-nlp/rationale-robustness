Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne .
He had his cousin , the former Amyntas IV , executed .
He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed , but spared a third , Alexander Lyncestes .
Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa , her daughter by Philip , burned alive .
When Alexander learned about this , he was furious .
Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus , who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra 's uncle .
Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes , regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens .
Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander , and following Cleopatra 's murder , Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive .
Alexander spared Arrhidaeus , who was by all accounts mentally disabled , possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias .
News of Philip 's death roused many states into revolt , including Thebes , Athens , Thessaly , and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon .
When news of the revolts reached Alexander , he responded quickly .
Though advised to use diplomacy , Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly .
He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa , and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa .
When the Thessalians awoke the next day , they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered , adding their cavalry to Alexander 's force .
He then continued south towards the Peloponnese .
Alexander stopped at Thermopylae , where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth .
Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels .
The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander 's stay in Corinth .
