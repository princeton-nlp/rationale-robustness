A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a $ 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish - speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims .
The U.S. Department of Justice two - year grant will begin Oct. 1 , which is the start of domestic violence awareness month .
U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson .
The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties .
" This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women , men and children who are victims of abuse , " Tanner said in a news statement .
The organization does n't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations , said the organization 's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos .
He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year .
The group closes about 2,500 cases a year .
The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about $ 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000 , Xanthopoulos said .
" The drop in poverty is a good thing , but there is still a great need out there , " he said .
" So this was a very good thing . "
Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations , said Margaret Cole , executive director of Wo / Men 's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson .
Her organization and Northwest Safeline are partners in the grant .
Northwest Safeline , based in Dyersburg , is a family violence intervention project that serves Dyer , Obion , Lake and Crockett counties .
