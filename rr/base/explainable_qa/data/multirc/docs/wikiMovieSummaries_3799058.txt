The year is 1980 , and the film opens with the launch of the JX-1 Hayabusa spaceship into outer space .
The ship , originally sent to collect data on Saturn , has its course diverted to investigate the mysterious star Gorath , reported as being 6000 times the size of the Earth .
It is feared that the star 's path could come dangerously close to Earth .
The JX-1 reaches locates Gorath and it 's much smaller than earth but with 6000 times the gravity .
The JX-1 radio 's back any data about the star but gets sucked into the star 's gravitational field which drags the ship into Gorath , incinerating it .
Japan and the rest of the world are stunned by the discovery and , after some reluctance , send up the JX-2 Ootori spaceship for a voyage to investigate Gorath .
The United Nations band together to discover a solution to the problem , and decide that their only solutions are to either destroy Gorath or move the planet out of the way .
Back on Earth , the UN decides on the plan to move the Earth out of the way of Gorath , the South Pole Operation .
The plan is to have atomic energy channeled through huge atomic furnaces 500 meters below the surface , then fed though enormous pipes called thrusters which will all fire in unison .
But for this to work they will need an area 600 kilometers producing an atomic force equal to that of 6,600,000,000 megatons to move the Earth 400,000 kilometers way from Gorath .
This massive project meets some setbacks such as cave - ins , but presses on .
