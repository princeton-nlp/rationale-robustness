With a budget of $ 329 million , LSC provides civil legal assistance to low - income people in every county in America , Kleiman said .
NLAP was created in 1968 .
A decade later , the agency used a $ 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and $ 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown , according to Erlenborn 's letter to Kaynard .
In 1980 , NLAP used $ 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway , the letter said .
On Nov. 14 , 2001 , NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association , according to county property records .
The local bar paid $ 5 for the building , which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop .
The local bar said it would maintain the building for " legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina , " the records said .
The King Street building appears to be vacant .
Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston .
E. Douglas Pratt - Thomas , president of the local bar , was not available for comment .
Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax - exempt .
But Randall Goldman , managing partner of Patrick Properties , which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St. , said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between $ 700,000 and $ 900,000 .
" That building , which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars , should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina , " Kleiman said .
LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or " we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston .
We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina , " he said .
Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston " had honored their obligation , this would not be an issue . "
