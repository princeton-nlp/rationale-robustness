Miguel and his mother suffer a car accident ; Miguel s mother dies , but the boy miraculously survives without any injuries .
Given that his father died before he was born , he goes on to live with his grandmother in Sintra .
There he is reunited with Carlos , his best childhood friend .
Miguel asks for a transfer to the local university in Sintra and pursues a degree in History .
On the first day of lectures , before entering the Medieval History classroom , Miguel watches someone approach .
A girl walks in his direction , and as she enters their eyes immediately meet .
Her name is Sofia .
Miguel and Sofia immediately feel an explosive and overwhelming attraction .
The presence of Sofia will also awaken unknown abilities in Miguel , both physically and mentally .
Though Miguel and Sofia do not know it , their destinies are connected .
Sofia is a vampire that belongs to the family of Hector , L dia , and the provocative Valentina .
Sofia is not a mere vampire ; she is the next step in vampiric evolution , because she is immune to sunlight .
Therefore she is protected by Hector and L dia , envied by Valentina and coveted by Hector 's creator , the deadly Victor .
Like Sofia , Miguel is not a mere human .
The first episode suggests that he may be the son of the vampire Charles , Which makes him a dhampir and , consequently , gives him powers against the vampires .
This is explained by the fact that damphyrs inherit the powers of vampires , but none of their weaknesses .
