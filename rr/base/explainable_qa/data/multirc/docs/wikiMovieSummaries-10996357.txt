Juzo Murasaki arrives at a work construction area to take on his new job as a construction worker .
To his quiet dismay , his supervising boss turns out to be Toru Akai , who with his gang had made Juzo 's middle school life a living hell .
Akai , however , does n't recognize Juzo .
Juzo 's more disconcerted when he discovers that Akai lives with his wife , Nozomi Akai and their toddler son above Juzo 's new apartment .
As Juzo emotionally struggles to handle these unexpected developments , a mysterious and seemingly malicious hooded figure appears .
It calls itself Number 13 .
As Juzo attempts to control increasing number of flashbacks and a spiral fall into psychological darkness , Akai constantly picks on Juzo and other work colleagues including Seki Hajime , a former middle school student who becomes Juzo 's casual friend in spite of Juzo 's anti - social tendencies , at work .
Meanwhile Akai 's wife , Nozomi , attempts to make friends with Juzo and entrusting the care of her toddler son to Juzo .
She proudly shows Juzo her husband 's school photos .
In one class photo , Juzo 's space is marked with an X to show he was absent .
Juzo suffers a severe flashback to explain his absence that day : in their school 's science room , Akai and his friends have thrown acid at Juzo 's face .
Seki becomes suspicious about Juzo 's increasingly odd behavior and goes to inform Arai at the work site , but Arai dismisses him without giving him a chance to speak .
During this incident , Seki does n't realize he 's being watched by Number 13 , but as soon as he does , Number 13 kills him .
