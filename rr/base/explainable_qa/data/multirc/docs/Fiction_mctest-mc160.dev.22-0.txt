It was a beautiful sunny and warm day .
I was working outside in my garden .
I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job , but I was enjoying the day .
I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake .
It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake .
On this day , I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake .
I got up from my garden and walked to the lake .
I kept hearing this strange sound .
It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice .
I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time .
The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to " say " to other lake birds .
There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short .
Then there is the " where are you " call which is long , slow and loud .
But this sound was not like any I had ever heard .
I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything .
But , no luck .
I still kept hearing this low talking sound .
I had now totally given up weeding .
Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun .
But where was it coming from ?
I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing .
Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats .
There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water .
I spotted them !
It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them .
They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish .
The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish .
I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour .
I felt very special that I got to see this .
It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening .
