The film is set in Igloolik in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium .
http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php The wind is blowing over a bleak snowy landscape while a man tries to herd away some marauding dogs .
We hear the voice of an old man singing a childish song .
Inside a stone house a strange shaman by the name of Tungajuaq , who comes from up north , is singing playfully to the gathered community and camp leader Kumaglak .
But among the spectators there are some mistrustful faces .
Flash forward to another day .
Qulitalik is bidding goodbye to his sister Panikpak , wife of Kumaglak , promising to come if she calls for help in her heart .
She gives him her husband 's rabbit 's foot for spiritual power .
Qulitalik tells his sister , ` ` Tulimaq is the one they 'll go after now . ''
It seems that Qulitalik is leaving to escape a threat , and the hope is that one day he will return to help .
As Panikpak watches him leave , we hear a voice - over from a woman : ` ` We never knew what he was or why it happened .
Evil came to us like Death .
It just happened and we had to live with it . ''
Flash back to the original scene in the stone house .
The visitor and the camp leader Kumaglak are in a ` ` friendly '' spiritual duel involving binding in leather thongs .
But Panikpak is startled when the stone lamp in front of her breaks in half , and , to the horror of those present , Kumaglak falls over dead .
The visitor removes the leader 's walrus - tooth necklace from Kumaglak 's body , and , passing by Tulimaq , he puts the necklace around the neck of Sauri , the son of the murdered leader Kumaglak , saying , ` ` Be careful what you wish for '' .
