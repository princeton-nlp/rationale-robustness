{ { lang } } centers on a man who roams the street night after night .
Hidden under his hat and rain jacket he strives for one goal : to find the culprit - the one whom he can make responsible for his suffering .
If he wanted to , he could confront him , but he lacks the audacity to do so .
He considers suicide , but his courage fails him once again .
The options do not appear to present him with a way out and would not personally satisfy him .
Finley blames not himself , but only others .
In this case he looks to his girlfriend , Violet .
He drowns Violet in the bath whilst giving her a massage , Which had become a common ritual for them .
On one hand he does this out of malice , on the other to be close to her just one more time .
Through this action he wishes to break the growing distance he has come to feel between them , though the actual outcome is the infliction of the greatest possible loneliness , as he turns into a monster .
Finley only realizes with hindsight that his misdeeds far surpass those of Violet .
