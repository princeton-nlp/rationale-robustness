Alexander the Great 's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures .
Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day .
The Alexander Romance , in particular , has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures , from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek .
Alexander may already have considered himself as the " King of Asia " after his victory at Issos , a conception strengthened by his subsequent successes .
The conception might have inspired the title given to Alexander in Babylonian documents , " king of the world ( since " king of Asia " had no meaning in Babylonian geography ) .
It might also be alluded in the sarcastic comments by Anaxarchus , trying to rouse Alexander after the murder of Cleitus .
or in the orator Demades ' comments that if Alexander were dead , " The whole world would stink of his corpse " .
Alexander is called " kosmokrator " , ruler of the world , in the later Alexander Romance .
Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore , more so than any other ancient figure .
The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek ( " O Megalexandros " ) is a household name , and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play .
One well - known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship 's prow during a storm and ask the captain " Is King Alexander alive ? " .
The correct answer is " He is alive and well and rules the world ! " , causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm .
Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea , all hands aboard .
