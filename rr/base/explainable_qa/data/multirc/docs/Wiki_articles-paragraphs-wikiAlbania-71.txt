Albanian was proved to be an Indo - European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp .
The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo - European language family .
Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco - Thracian .
( Illyrian and Daco - Thracian , however , might have been closely related languages ; see Thraco - Illyrian . ) Establishing longer relations , Albanian is often compared to Balto - Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other , both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian .
Moreover , Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed , long o has fallen to a , much like in the former and opposite the latter .
Likewise , Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives , much in the way Balto - Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives .
The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications , mainly of the Catholic region in the North , but also of the Orthodox in the South .
The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy , trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German .
