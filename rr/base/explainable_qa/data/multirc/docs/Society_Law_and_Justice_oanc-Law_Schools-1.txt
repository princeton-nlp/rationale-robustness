Life for the partners of Cates , Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law .
Instead of lunches at Lut � � ce , they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens .
Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners , not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden .
To make ends meet , one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse .
Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab .
A sign of failure , of a feeble economy , perhaps ?
Hardly .
They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools , which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there .
Forget the lure of large firms , the security of a government post .
Here is how to grapple " in the service of justice , " as many of the schools put it , instead .
Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation 's legal needs , the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition , pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own , all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford .
This is not pro bono legal work ; it is " low bono , " a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for .
While its practitioners do charge for their services , they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible .
" When you go into this kind of social justice law , it 's really brutal and you 're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there 's a light at the end of the tunnel , " said Fred Rooney , director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law , from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates , Katalinic & Lund graduated last May.
" But if our graduates do n't do it , the millions of people who can not access justice in this country will continue to soar . "
The movement , primly called the consortium , started four years ago by CUNY , Northeastern University , the University of Maryland and St. Mary 's Law School in Texas .
( St. Mary 's later dropped out . ) Since then , it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks : the University of Michigan , Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools , New York Law School , University of New Mexico School of Law , Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School .
It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more .
