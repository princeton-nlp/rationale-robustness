Alexander then chased Darius , first into Media , and then Parthia .
The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny , and was taken prisoner by Bessus , his Bactrian satrap and kinsman .
As Alexander approached , Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius ' successor as Artaxerxes V , before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander .
Alexander buried Darius ' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral .
He claimed that , while dying , Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne .
The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius .
Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him .
This campaign , initially against Bessus , turned into a grand tour of central Asia .
Alexander founded a series of new cities , all called Alexandria , including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan , and Alexandria Eschate ( " The Furthest " ) in modern Tajikistan .
The campaign took Alexander through Media , Parthia , Aria ( West Afghanistan ) , Drangiana , Arachosia ( South and Central Afghanistan ) , Bactria ( North and Central Afghanistan ) , and Scythia .
Spitamenes , who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana , in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy , one of Alexander 's trusted companions , and Bessus was executed .
However , when , at some point later , Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army , Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt .
Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes , defeating him in the Battle of Gabai .
After the defeat , Spitamenes was killed by his own men , who then sued for peace .
