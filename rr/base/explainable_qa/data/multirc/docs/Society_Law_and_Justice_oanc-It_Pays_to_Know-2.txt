When 74-year - old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD - subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month , she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights .
It turns out the manager of the seniors complex , its attorneys and government overseers were unaware , too .
Lee Kemp , a hearing - impaired World War II disabled vet , also was evicted , but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put .
Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp. , the building 's owner , that Kemp 's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing .
That did n't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing 's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out .
Meanwhile , Sweat 's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials , federal housing officials , state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother 's rights .
Nobody knew .
Blaustein then took Sweat 's case along with Kemp 's and demanded her ousting be rectified .
Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out - of - town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed .
The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex , he said , and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp .
Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift , however .
Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company , they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants .
When she called HUD to make sure , the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back .
Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates .
He also is retaining new attorneys .
