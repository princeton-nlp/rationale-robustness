Sara wanted to play on a baseball team .
She had never tried to swing a bat and hit a baseball before .
Her Dad gave her a bat and together they went to the park to practice .
Sara wondered if she could hit a ball .
She was n't sure if she would be any good .
She really wanted to play on a team and wear a real uniform .
She could n't wait to get to the park and test out her bat .
When Sara and her Dad reached the park , Sara grabbed the bat and stood a few steps away from her Dad .
Sara waited as her Dad pitched the ball to her .
Her heart was beating fast .
She missed the first few pitches .
She felt like quitting but kept trying .
Soon she was hitting the ball very far .
She was very happy and she could n't wait to sign up for a real team .
Her Dad was very proud of her for not giving up .
