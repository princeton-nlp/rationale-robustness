Dr. Benjamin Stone is a hotshot young surgeon who longs to leave the drudgery of a Washington , D.C. emergency room and finally leaps at his chance at more money and less death as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills .
On his last day , Ben 's relationship with his co - workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one .
None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase ` ` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out .
Ben 's cross - country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina .
The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans , who sentences him to community service at a nearby hospital .
Ben offers to pay for the fence , but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back .
Defeated , he reports to the hospital , where Nurse Packer humbles him by ordering him to clock in and out , as would a factory worker .
Though upset , Ben quickly makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson , the town cafe 's proprietor / head waitress , and Melvin , the local mechanic tasked with repairing Ben 's car .
Ben soon finds his clinic work to be much more laid - back than the emergency room .
He has simple cases such as spots before the eyes , fishing hook impalings , and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple , whose baby he later delivers .
The experience also humbles Ben when he mistreats a case of mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis in the child .
