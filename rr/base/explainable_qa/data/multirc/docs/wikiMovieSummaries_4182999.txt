The movie is a powerful story that deals with feminism and patriarchy in the middle class of India .
It is shot in the present and past tense showing lives of the characters Mahender and Sudha as they lived together as well as separately .
The movie starts with Mahender getting down at the railway station and making his way to the waiting room just as it starts to rain heavily .
A woman , Sudha , is already sitting in the waiting room .
On seeing him , she tries to hide her face from him but later they confront each other .
Mahender has an accomplished business dealing with photography .
He respects his grandfather immensely .
Incidentally , he had been engaged to Sudha for 5 years but always made some excuse to delay their wedding .
However , this time his grandfather has fixed the wedding on the first week of the following month .
He reveals to Sudha that he is having an affair with one of the most radical representations of feminism in a girl called Maya .
He returns to tell Maya , but Maya has disappeared , leaving him some poetry .
Mahender then marries Sudha and is quite happy , but the sudden return of Maya causes tensions in their married life .
Mahender frequently tells Sudha about all the beautifully poignant , loving and authentic things Maya did over the years that they lived together .
Later , Maya tries to commit suicide , and this leads to Mahender spending time with her over a few weeks .
Sudha , not knowing about Maya 's suicide attempt and therefore believing that Mahender is being unfaithful to her , feels that her marriage was a mistake , and questions Mahender about his intentions .
