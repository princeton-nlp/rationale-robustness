From Babylon , Alexander went to Susa , one of the Achaemenid capitals , and captured its legendary treasury .
He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Royal Road .
Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city .
He had to storm the pass of the Persian Gates ( in the modern Zagros Mountains ) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury .
On entering Persepolis , Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days .
Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months .
During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes and spread to the rest of the city .
Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War .
