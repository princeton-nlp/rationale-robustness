In Italy , he returned to painting , at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen .
These include portraits and altarpieces , notably , the Paumgartner altarpiece and the Adoration of the Magi .
In early 1506 , he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507 .
By this time Durer 's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied .
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo .
This was the altar - piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands .
It includes portraits of members of Venice 's German community , but shows a strong Italian influence .
It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor Rudolf II and taken to Prague .
Other paintings Durer produced in Venice include The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch , Christ Disputing with the Doctors ( supposedly produced in a mere five days ) , and a number of smaller works .
