Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to leave because of her mean mother .
One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let her .
The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall when her mother was sleeping .
She wandered out a good ways .
Finally she went into the forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves .
There she met a young man who was running .
His name was John .
John asked the princess why such a beautiful woman like her was out in the middle of a forest .
She said that she had been trapped for her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother .
The man said that he would take the princess to a castle that was near .
He also said that he thought that she may be the missing princess .
As they go through the forest they run into many problems .
They see that they are lost and have no way of finding where to go .
After several days pass , the princess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are .
She sees that the castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain .
After thinking of the best way to get there , John and the princess go to the castle where they live for the rest of their lives .
