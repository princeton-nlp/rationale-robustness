Alice Adams is the youngest daughter of the Adams family .
Her father is an invalid who used to work in Mr. Lamb 's factory as a clerk .
Her mother is embittered by her husband 's lack of ambition and upset by the snubs her daughter endures because of their poverty .
Alice 's older brother , Walter , is a gambler who can not hold a job and who associates with African Americans .
As the film begins , Alice attends a dance given by the wealthy Henrietta Lamb .
She has no date , and is escorted to the occasion by Walter .
Alice is a social climber like her mother , and engages in socially inappropriate behavior and conversation in an attempt to impress others .
At the dance , Alice meets wealthy Arthur Russell , who is charmed by her despite her poverty .
Alice 's father is employed as a clerk in a factory owned by Mr. Lamb , who has kept Adams on salary for years despite his lengthy illness .
Alice 's mother nags her husband into quitting his job and pouring his life savings into a glue factory .
Mr. Lamb ostracizes Mr. Adams from society , believing that Adams stole the glue formula from him .
Alice is the subject of cruel town gossip , which Russell ignores .
Alice invites Russell to the Adams home for a fancy meal .
She and her mother put on airs , the entire family dresses inappropriately in formal wear despite the hot summer night , and the Adams pretend that they eat caviar and fancy , rich - tasting food all the time .
The dinner is ruined by the slovenly behavior and poor cooking skills of the maid the Adams have hired for the occasion , Malena .
