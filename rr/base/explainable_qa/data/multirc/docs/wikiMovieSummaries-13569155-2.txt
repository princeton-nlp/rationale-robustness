` ` The Octopus , '' a masked crime lord , is bent on crippling the nation with a wave of terror .
He starts with the transportation system and then moves onto industry .
He demands tribute from railroad magnates and other captains of industry .
Richard Wentworth , an amateur criminologist who is friendly with the police , is secretly ` ` The Spider , '' a masked vigilante equally determined to wipe the Octopus and his gang off the face of the earth .
Pleasant and smiling in civilian life , Wentworth is often ruthless as the Spider , slinging two guns against the public enemies who attack him .
Wentworth also masquerades as affable underworld lowlife Blinky McQuade .
Disguised as McQuade , Wentworth can infiltrate gangland at the hired - gun level and keep current on the gang 's plans .
The only people who know Wentworth 's other identities are his assistants Jackson and Ram Singh , his butler Jenkins , and his fianc e Nita .
The Octopus was a villain in a single issue pulp believed to have been written by Norvell Page who wrote most of The Spider pulp stories .
He is garbed completely in white and is only ever seen sitting in a chair .
Unlike the pulps , The Spider is garbed in a lightweight full length costume with web - like markings on it Which resemble Spiderman 's costume .
The serial follows the standard formula of fights , shoot - outs , Wentworth 's friends being kidnapped at various times and having to be rescued .
Each chapter ends with The Spider or his friends in deep trouble , often about to be killed , but the effect is spoiled by a trailer for the next episode Which shows them in full health and fighting the villains .
