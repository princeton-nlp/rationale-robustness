In 1880 , his son John Church Hamilton commissioned Carl Conrads to sculpt a granite statue , now located in Central Park , New York City .
One statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy , at least concerning the surrounding architecture .
Kate Sturges Buckingham ( 1858 - 1937 ) , of the Buckingham Fountain family , commissioned the monument .
Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton " secured the nation 's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking .
Consequently , John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a " colossal architectural setting " for it .
The proposed 80-foot tall columned shelter was poorly received .
By Ms. Buckingham 's death in 1937 , the sculpture 's setting .
location and design were uncertain .
Conspiracy allegations surfaced , and the matter became mired in litigation .
After the courts ordered the construction to be completed by 1953 , the trustees hired architect Samuel A. Marx .
The structure was completed , had structural problems , and was eventually demolished in 1993 .
The statue was gilded , and is still on display .
A statue , by James Earle Fraser , was dedicated on May 17 , 1923 , on the south terrace of the Treasury Building , in Washington .
