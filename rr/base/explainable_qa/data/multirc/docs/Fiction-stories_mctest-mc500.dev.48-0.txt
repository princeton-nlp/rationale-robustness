Jack and Mackenzie wanted to do something fun during their day off from school .
They knew that the library had story time on Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday .
Their mother told them they could go to the library every Tuesday for their story time .
They packed up the car and drove to the library , ready for a fun morning .
When they arrived to the story room , there were lots of other children their age , all sitting cross - legged and ready for the story of the day .
The teacher told them they would be reading " The Wild Horse " .
She began to tell the story of Majestic , the wild horse who could not be calmed .
His people had tried and tried to break him , but he was wild at heart .
Every time they took him to the river to drink , he would run straight into the water and get soaking wet !
He would splash and play until he was ready to go back home , where he would sleep for hours , having worn himself out playing .
