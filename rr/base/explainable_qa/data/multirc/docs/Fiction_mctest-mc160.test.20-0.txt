One day a boy was looking for a school lunch in the fridge .
He was looking for something that was good for him , but also something that tasted good .
He was going to school , and needed something to keep him going and doing well in class .
Recently he had been eating cookies for lunch , and was tired by the end of the day .
The cookies came from the school lunchroom , and his mom did n't know about them .
Finally he got tired of cookies and thought he needed something good for him .
So , he asked his mom to come help him out .
First he got a doughnut .
" That 's not good for you at all ! "
said his mom .
So , his mom got a big bag of broccoli .
" Yuk , I hate the taste of broccoli , " said the boy .
They looked and looked and could n't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him .
Finally , they saw the perfect thing : some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend .
It was so delicious the first time , and it tasted great cold for lunch .
The chicken had the types of food he needed to get through the day .
