Pester came running into the room .
He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog .
He 'd seen a dog before , every cat has , and he used to live with a black dog named Henry , but he 'd never seen a brown one before .
It seemed strange to him , but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring .
That still confused him .
He thought he liked this dog , not because of the color , but because it was small .
And it was so hairy .
It was a like a mop that could run around .
He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it .
She was kind of cute for a dog , Pester thought to himself .
He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it .
He tapped her ears as she went by , and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention .
After a little more of this , Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap .
