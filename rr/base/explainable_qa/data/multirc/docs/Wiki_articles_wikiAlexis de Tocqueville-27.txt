Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons : first , his understanding of the international situation and France 's position in the world , and , second , changes in French society .
Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would " restore national pride , threatened " , he believed , by " The gradual softening of social mores " in the middle classes .
Their taste for " material pleasures " was spreading to the whole of society , giving it " an example of weakness and egotism " .
Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud , Tocqueville went so far to claim that " war in Africa is a science .
Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success .
One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread , perfected and made everyone aware of this new science . "
Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations , one for European colonists and one for the Arab population .
Such a two - tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code , which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews , whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second - class citizenship .
