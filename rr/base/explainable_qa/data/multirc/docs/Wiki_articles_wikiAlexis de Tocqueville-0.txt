Alexis - Charles - Henri Clerel de Tocqueville ( French : [ aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil ] ; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859 ) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America ( appearing in two volumes : 1835 and 1840 ) and The Old Regime and the Revolution ( 1856 ) .
In both of these , he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals , as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies .
Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville 's travels in the United States , and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science .
Tocqueville was active in French politics , first under the July Monarchy ( 1830 - 1848 ) and then during the Second Republic ( 1849 - 1851 ) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution .
He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte 's 2 December 1851 coup , and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution .
He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV .
The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals .
Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government , but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy .
