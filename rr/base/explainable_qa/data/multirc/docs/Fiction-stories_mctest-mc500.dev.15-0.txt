One day Mary took a walk to the park .
The park was very close to her house .
One her way to the park she passed her friend Kim 's house .
Mary stopped by and asked if Kim wanted to play .
Kim said yes .
Mary and Kim walked together to the park .
John 's house was three houses down .
Mary and Kim stopped by to ask John if he wanted to play at the park .
John said no .
He was afraid of being chased by a squirrel .
Mary worried that John did n't like her , but John thought she was a good friend .
So Mary and Kim went to the park to play .
They loved the park .
They loved the flowers , and the swings !
Soon it was dinnertime and the girls went home .
What a lovely day at the park .
