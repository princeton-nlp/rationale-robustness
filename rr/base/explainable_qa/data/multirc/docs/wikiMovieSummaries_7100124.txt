Porky is looking all over the big city for a hotel room , but due to a convention there are no vacancies .
Porky takes the only available vacancy at one hotel , but will have to share with Daffy Duck , who is a very loud , obnoxious and annoying sort .
Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend ` ` Hymie '' , but Porky wo n't believe that .
Daffy spends the rest of the night annoying Porky : pestering him with questions , shaking the bed , spilling water from a glass , hogging the blanket and finally literally sending the both of them flying off the bed when Daffy kicks , and startles , Porky with his literally frozen feet .
Fed up with his antics , Porky stuffs Daffy in a pillow case and drops him out of the window .
As Porky goes back to bed , Daffy returns bandaged , but shakes them off and prepares to get revenge .
Daffy tricks the half - asleep pig into stepping out of a window thinking he 's boarding a train .
Daffy hides the window saying it 's ` ` too gruesome '' to watch .
Suddenly he hears train noises , and behind the shade , sees the still - drowsy Porky pulling away on an actual train and waving at Daffy .
Daffy finds this silly .
Then he bounces all around the room , ` ` Hoo - Hoo ! ''
- ing wildly .
