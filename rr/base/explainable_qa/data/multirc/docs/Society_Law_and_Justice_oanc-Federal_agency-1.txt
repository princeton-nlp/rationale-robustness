A congressional agency that funds legal services for low - income Americans is battling Charleston lawyers over control of buildings that once housed legal assistance programs in Charleston , Georgetown and Conway .
At stake is prime real estate in the coastal cities , including a Charleston building in the heart of upscale commercial development on upper King Street .
The Washington - based Legal Services Corp. wants the buildings transferred to the S.C. Centers for Equal Justice , said LSC spokesman Eric Kleiman .
The LSC was once the funding agency for the Neighborhood Legal Assistance Program Corp. in Charleston .
In January , the LSC funding went to the Greenville - based equal justice centers .
In an Aug. 21 letter to NLAP board chairman Gerald A. Kaynard , LSC president John N. Erlenborn said : " If NLAP fails to effectuate these transfers by Aug. 31 , LSC will take all necessary steps to protect its interest in these properties . "
Kaynard did not return repeated phone calls from The Post and Courier .
As part of its funding agreement , the LSC requires property purchased with government funds be returned to the nonprofit corporation if a local agency loses its grant , Kleiman said .
In August , the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that requirement in a lawsuit LSC filed in a property dispute with a legal services program in Big Stone Gap , Va. Kleiman said , " We will continue to work with NLAP to work out an orderly transfer of the property .
We hope this can be resolved amicably . "
Last year , NLAP lost its federal grant with a nationwide consolidation of legal aid programs .
In January , the federal agency awarded a $ 4.4 million grant to the Centers for Equal Justice , which has a Charleston area office and sites in 11 other South Carolina cities .
