Albrecht Durer ( /'dU@r@r , ' djU@r@r/ ; German : [ ' albRect ' dy : Ra ] ; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528 ) was a painter , printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance .
Born in Nuremberg , Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties , due to his high - quality woodcut prints .
He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time , including Raphael , Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci , and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings , his preferred technique in his later prints , altarpieces , portraits and self - portraits , watercolours and books .
The woodcuts , such as the Apocalypse series ( 1498 ) , retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work .
His well - known engravings include the Knight , Death , and the Devil ( 1513 ) , Saint Jerome in his Study ( 1514 ) and Melencolia I ( 1514 ) , which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation .
His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists , while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium .
Durer 's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art , through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists , has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance .
This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises , which involve principles of mathematics , perspective and ideal proportions .
