The Legal Services Corp. ( LSC ) , a quasi - governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor , would receive $ 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush 's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001 .
If approved , the hold - the - line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year , but it could be worse for the organization : Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether , saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy .
Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996 , when Congress approved restrictions ( PL 104 - 134 ) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take .
( 1996 Almanac , p.
5 - 36 ) Republicans cut the organization 's budget deeply in 1996 , but its funding has recovered slowly .
Last month , in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003 , the Senate added a onetime increase of $ 19 million , which , if approved in the final version , would bring the LSC budget to $ 348 million .
The money would go to help states , such as Michigan and Ohio , that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households .
If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president 's desk , LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization 's fiscal 2004 funding .
The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s ; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 ( PL 93 - 355 ) .
LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies , which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - $ 11,075 a year for an individual and $ 22,625 for a family of four .
Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases , custody cases and other such matters , according to LSC .
Since 1996 , lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures , filing class - action suits , participating in political demonstrations or strikes , pursuing abortion - related litigation , representing illegal aliens or prisoners , or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs
