Defeated last month for re - election , Gov. Roy Barnes announced Tuesday that he will spend his first six months out of office as an unpaid attorney for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society , where he will represent poor people .
" One day I 'll probably do some legal work that I will charge a handsome fee for - at least I hope there are those that are still willing to pay , " he told reporters .
" But for now , I think it is important to fulfill my duty as a lawyer to help those who need it the most , to speak for those who can not speak for themselves and to defend those whose life and livelihoods depend on it , " he said .
Previous governors have gone to prestigious law firms , joined corporate boards or returned to thriving businesses .
" I do n't think I 've ever heard of anybody doing this before , " Emory University political science professor Merle Black said .
" If he 's actually going to represent individuals for that organization , they 're going to get great representation .
You 're going to get some powerful legal muscle there , " Mr. Black said .
Mr. Barnes said he already has his first case , but he would n't say what it is .
Atlanta Legal Aid provides civil services to poor people in five metro Atlanta counties .
Mr. Barnes said he was hoping to send a message to other lawyers .
" This privilege to practice law is just that - it 's a privilege .
And it comes with a cost and it comes with a bill .
We as lawyers have a responsibility to make sure that everyone , regardless of whether they can afford it or not , has quality representation .
And if we do n't do that , then we 're not much of a profession , " he said .
Steven Gottlieb , the society 's executive director , said , " I ca n't imagine anything that could be better than to have the governor of the state , in his first act as a private citizen , donate six months of his time to represent poor people .
