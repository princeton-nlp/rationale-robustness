I 'm here to tell you the story of a robot named Carl .
He came from a far away land known as Factory .
Carl was sad because he was missing a part called a tire .
He also needed a sun gatherer .
But , the tire was more important .
Once Carl got all these parts he could travel to his new home in the nation of Lab and the city of Office .
It was a tricky thing to get there with missing parts .
Just as he had given up hope Carl got a message from Mr. X saying the new parts were ready to be delivered .
This made the robot very happy .
The parts arrived a few days later and Carl put them in with 2 days of work .
After this Carl began to travel the last bit of his goal to get to his new job .
After this Carl took 10 days to get to Lab .
