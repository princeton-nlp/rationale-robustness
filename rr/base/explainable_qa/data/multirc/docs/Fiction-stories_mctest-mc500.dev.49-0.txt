Lucy is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird .
One Saturday afternoon , she sits at the kitchen table .
She draws a picture of her family .
She makes sure to draw her mom named Martha wearing a purple dress , because that is her favorite .
She draws many yellow feathers for her pet bird named Andy .
After she is done , she gives the picture to her mom .
Her mom hangs it up on the silver refrigerator .
The next day , Lucy 's mom comes home with a brown dog named Oliver .
She tells Lucy that she is pet - sitting , which is like babysitting but with a friend 's dog .
Lucy 's mom tells her she can play with the dog as long as she takes good care of him .
Lucy is excited .
She pets Oliver nicely on his soft back .
He wags his tail .
He barks , " Woof ! "
and shows he wants to play fetch with her .
Lucy giggles and throws a ball for him to catch .
She wishes her bird could play like this with her every day !
