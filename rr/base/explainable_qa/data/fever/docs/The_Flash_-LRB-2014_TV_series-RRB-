The Flash is an American television series developed by Greg Berlanti , Andrew Kreisberg and Geoff Johns , airing on The CW .
It is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash , a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds .
It is a spin-off from Arrow , existing in the same fictional universe .
The series follows Allen , portrayed by Grant Gustin , a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed , which he uses to fight criminals , including others who have also gained superhuman abilities .
Initially envisioned as a backdoor pilot , the positive reception Gustin received during two appearances as Barry on Arrow led to executives choosing to develop a full pilot to make use of a larger budget and help flesh out Barry 's world in more detail .
Colleen Atwood , costume designer for Arrow , was brought in to design the Flash 's suit .
The creative team wanted to make sure that the Flash would resemble his comic book counterpart , and not simply be a poor imitation .
The series is primarily filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
The Flash premiered in North America on October 7 , 2014 , where the pilot became the second-most watched premiere in the history of The CW , after The Vampire Diaries in 2009 .
