Blue Velvet is a 1986 American neo-noir mystery film , written and directed by David Lynch .
Blending psychological horror with film noir , the film stars Kyle MacLachlan , Isabella Rossellini , Dennis Hopper and Laura Dern .
The title is taken from Bobby Vinton 's 1963 song of the same name .
The screenplay of Blue Velvet had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s , with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content .
After the commercial and critical failure of Lynch 's Dune -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , the director made attempts at developing a more `` personal story '' , somewhat characteristic of the surrealist style displayed in his debut Eraserhead -LRB- 1977 -RRB- .
The independent studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group , owned at the time by Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis , agreed to finance and produce the film .
Blue Velvet initially received a divided critical response , with many stating that its objectionable content served little artistic purpose .
It nevertheless earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director and came to achieve cult status .
As an example of a director casting against the norm , it was credited for re-launching Hopper 's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond her previous work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman .
In the years since , the film has generated significant academic attention with regard to its thematic symbolism , and is now widely regarded as one of Lynch 's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s .
Publications including Sight & Sound , Time , Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time .
In 2008 , Blue Velvet was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest American mystery films ever made .
