Uranium-235 -LRB- 235U -RRB- is an isotope of uranium making up about 0.72 % of natural uranium .
Unlike the predominant isotope uranium-238 , it is fissile , i.e. , it can sustain a fission chain reaction .
It is the only fissile isotope that is a primordial nuclide or found in significant quantity in nature .
Uranium-235 has a half-life of 703.8 million years .
It was discovered in 1935 by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster .
Its -LRB- fission -RRB- nuclear cross section for slow thermal neutrons is about 584.994 barns .
For fast neutrons it is on the order of 1 barn .
Most but not all neutron absorptions result in fission ; a minority result in neutron capture forming uranium-236 .
