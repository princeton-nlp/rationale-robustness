A web page , or webpage , is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers .
A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device .
The web page is what displays , but the term also refers to a computer file , usually written in HTML or comparable markup language .
Web browsers coordinate the various web resource elements for the written web page , such as style sheets , scripts , and images , to present the web page .
Typical web pages provide hypertext that includes a navigation bar or a sidebar menu to other web pages via hyperlinks , often referred to as links .
On a network , a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server .
On a higher level , the web server may restrict access to only a private network such as a corporate intranet or it provides access to the World Wide Web .
On a lower level , the web browser uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol -LRB- HTTP -RRB- to make such requests .
A static web page is delivered exactly as stored , as web content in the web server 's file system , while a dynamic web page is generated by a web application that is driven by server-side software or client-side scripting .
Dynamic website pages help the browser -LRB- the client -RRB- to enhance the web page through user input to the server .
