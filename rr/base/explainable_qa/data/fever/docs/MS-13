Members of MS are characterised by tattoos covering the body and also often the face , and by the use of their own sign language .
They are notorious for their use of violence and a subcultural moral code that predominantly consists of merciless revenge and cruel retributions .
This cruelty of the distinguished members of the `` Maras '' or `` Mareros '' earned them a path to be recruited by the Sinaloa Cartel battling against Los Zetas in an ongoing drug war in Mexico .
Their wide-ranging activities have drawn the attention of the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , who have initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members , arresting hundreds across the country .
