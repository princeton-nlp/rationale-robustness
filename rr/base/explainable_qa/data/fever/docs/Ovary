The ovary -LRB- From ovarium , literally `` egg '' or `` nut '' -RRB- is an ovum-producing reproductive organ , found in pairs in the female as part of the vertebrate female reproductive system .
Birds have only one functional ovary -LRB- the left -RRB- , while the other remains vestigial .
Ovaries in females are analogous to testes in males , in that they are both gonads and endocrine glands .
Although ovaries occur in a wide variety of animals , both vertebrate and invertebrate , this article is primarily about human ovaries .
