A dragon is a legendary creature , typically scaled or fire-spewing and with serpentine , reptilian or avian traits , that features in the myths of many cultures around world .
The two most well-known cultural traditions of dragon are
The European dragon , derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies .
Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence , and are uniquely six-limbed -LRB- four legs and a separate set of wings -RRB- .
The Chinese dragon , with counterparts in Japan -LRB- namely the Japanese dragon -RRB- , Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries .
Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence , and are quadrupeds -LRB- four legs and wingless -RRB- .
The two traditions may have evolved separately , but have influenced each other to a certain extent , particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries .
