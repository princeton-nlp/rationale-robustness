The United States dollar -LRB- sign : $ ; code : USD ; also abbreviated US$ and referred to as the dollar , U.S. dollar , or American dollar -RRB- is the official currency of the United States and its insular territories per the United States Constitution .
It is divided into 100 smaller cent units .
The circulating paper money consists of Federal Reserve Notes that are denominated in United States dollars .
The U.S. dollar is commodity money of silver as enacted by the Coinage Act of 1792 which determined the dollar to be 371 4/16 grain -LRB- 24.1 g -RRB- pure or 416 grain -LRB- 27.0 g -RRB- standard silver .
