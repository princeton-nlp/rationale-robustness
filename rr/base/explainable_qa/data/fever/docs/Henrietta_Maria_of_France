Henrietta Maria of France -LRB- Henriette Marie 25 November 1609 -- 10 September 1669 -RRB- was queen consort of England , Scotland , and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I .
She was mother of his two immediate successors , Charles II and James II .
Her Roman Catholicism made her unpopular in England , and also prohibited her from being crowned in an Anglican service ; therefore she never had a coronation .
She began to immerse herself in national affairs as civil war loomed on the horizon , and was compelled to seek refuge in France in 1644 , following the birth of her youngest daughter , Henrietta , during the height of the First English Civil War .
The execution of King Charles in 1649 left her impoverished .
She settled in Paris , and then returned to England after the Restoration of her eldest son , Charles , to the throne .
In 1665 , she moved back to Paris , where she died four years later .
The North American Province of Maryland was named in her honour , and the name was carried over into the current U.S. state of Maryland .
