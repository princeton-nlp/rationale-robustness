Graf won 22 Grand Slam singles titles .
Her 22 singles titles put her second on the list of Major wins by a tennis player -LRB- male or female -RRB- since the introduction of the Open Era in 1968 and is third all-time behind Margaret Court -LRB- 24 -RRB- and Serena Williams -LRB- 23 -RRB- .
In 1988 , she became the first and only tennis player -LRB- male or female -RRB- to achieve the Golden Slam by winning all four Grand Slam singles titles and the Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year .
Furthermore , she is the only tennis player to have won each Grand Slam event at least four times .
Graf was ranked world No. 1 by the Women 's Tennis Association -LRB- WTA -RRB- for a record 377 total weeks -- the longest period for which any player , male or female , has held the number-one ranking since the WTA and the Association of Tennis Professionals began issuing rankings .
She won 107 singles titles , which ranks her third on the WTA 's all-time list after Martina Navratilova -LRB- 167 titles -RRB- and Chris Evert -LRB- 157 titles -RRB- .
She and Margaret Court are the only players , male or female , to win three grand slams in a calendar year five times -LRB- 1988 , 1989 , 1993 , 1995 and 1996 -RRB- .
