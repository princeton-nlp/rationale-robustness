Pirates of the Caribbean is a dark ride at Disneyland , the Magic Kingdom , Tokyo Disneyland , and Disneyland Park in Paris .
The original version at Disneyland , which opened in 1967 , was the last attraction whose construction was overseen by Walt Disney ; he died three months before it opened .
The ride , which tells the story of a band of pirates and their troubles and exploits , was replicated at the Magic Kingdom in 1973 , at Tokyo Disneyland in 1983 , and at Disneyland Paris in 1992 .
Each of the initial four versions of the ride has a different fa√ßade , but a similar ride experience .
A reimagined version of the ride , Pirates of the Caribbean -- Battle for the Sunken Treasure , opened at the Shanghai Disneyland Park in 2016 .
The ride gave rise to the song `` Yo Ho -LRB- A Pirate 's Life for Me -RRB- '' written by George Bruns and Xavier Atencio .
It also became the basis for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series , which debuted in 2003 .
Since 2006 , Disney has incorporated characters from the film series into the Disneyland , Magic Kingdom , and Tokyo Disneyland versions of the rides .
