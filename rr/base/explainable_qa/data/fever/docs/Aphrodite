Aphrodite -LRB- -LSB- æfrəˈdaɪti -RSB- ; Greek : Αφροδίτη -LRB- Afrodíti -RRB- -RRB- is the Greek goddess of love , beauty , pleasure , and procreation .
She is identified with the planet Venus ; her Roman equivalent is the goddess -LSB- Venus -LRB- mythology -RRB- , Venus -RSB- .
Myrtle , roses , doves , sparrows and swans were sacred to her .
In Hesiod 's Theogony , Aphrodite was created from the sea foam -LRB- aphros -RRB- produced by Uranus 's genitals , which had been severed by Cronus .
In Homer 's Iliad , however , she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione .
In Plato -LRB- Symposium , 180e -RRB- , these two origins are said to be of hitherto separate entities : Aphrodite Ourania -LRB- a transcendent , `` Heavenly '' Aphrodite -RRB- and Aphrodite Pandemos -LRB- Aphrodite common to `` all the people '' -RRB- .
She had many other names , each emphasising a different aspect of the same goddess , or used by a different local cult .
Thus she was also known as Cytherea -LRB- Lady of Cythera -RRB- and Cypris -LRB- Lady of Cyprus -RRB- , both of which claimed to be her place of birth .
In Greek myth , the other gods feared that Aphrodite 's beauty might lead to conflict and war , through rivalry for her favours ; so Zeus married her off to Hephaestus .
Despite this , Aphrodite followed her own inclinations , and had many lovers -- both gods , such as Ares , and men , such as Anchises .
She played a role in the Eros and Psyche legend , and was both lover and surrogate mother of Adonis .
Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite .
