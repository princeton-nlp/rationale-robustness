Patch Adams is a 1998 semi-biographical comedy-drama film starring Robin Williams , Monica Potter , Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bob Gunton .
Directed by Tom Shadyac , it is based on the life story of Dr. Hunter `` Patch '' Adams and the book , Gesundheit : Good Health is a Laughing Matter , by Adams and Maureen Mylander .
Despite being poorly received by critics and Dr. Adams himself , the film was a box-office success , grossing over twice its budget in the United States alone .
