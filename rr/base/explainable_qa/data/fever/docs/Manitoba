The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south .
Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years .
In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived in the area when it was part of Rupert 's Land and owned by the Hudson 's Bay Company .
In 1869 , negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion .
The rebellion 's resolution led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province .
Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada .
