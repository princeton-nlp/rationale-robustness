Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting -LRB- newaza -RRB- fundamentals that were taught by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano , Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake .
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own art through the experiments , practices , and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Helio Gracie -LRB- who passed their knowledge on to their extended family -RRB- as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda , such as Luiz Franca .
BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller , weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger , stronger , heavier assailant by using proper technique , leverage , and most notably , taking the fight to the ground , and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the opponent .
BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations .
Sparring -LRB- commonly referred to as rolling -RRB- and live drilling play a major role in training , and a premium is placed on performance , especially in competition , in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system .
Since its inception in 1882 , its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu by an important difference that was passed on to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu : it is not solely a martial art , but it is also a sport ; a method for promoting physical fitness and building character in young people ; and , ultimately , a way -LRB- Do -RRB- of life .
