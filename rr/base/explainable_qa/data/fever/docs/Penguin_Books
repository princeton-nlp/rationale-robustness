Penguin Books is a British publishing house .
It was founded in 1935 by Sir Allen Lane as a line of the publishers The Bodley Head , only becoming a separate company the following year .
Penguin revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks , sold through Woolworths and other high street stores for sixpence , bringing high-quality paperback fiction and non-fiction to the mass market .
Penguin 's success demonstrated that large audiences existed for serious books .
Penguin also had a significant impact on public debate in Britain , through its books on British culture , politics , the arts , and science .
Penguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House , an emerging conglomerate which was formed in 2013 by the merger of the two publishers .
Formerly , Penguin Group was wholly owned by Pearson PLC , the global media company which also owned the Financial Times , but it now retains only a minority holding of 47 % of the stock against Random House owner Bertelsmann which controls the majority stake .
It is one of the largest English-language publishers , formerly known as the `` Big Six '' , now the `` Big Five '' .
