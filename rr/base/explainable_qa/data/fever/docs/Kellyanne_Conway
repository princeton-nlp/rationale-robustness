Kellyanne Elizabeth Conway -LRB- n√©e Fitzpatrick ; born January 20 , 1967 -RRB- is the current Counselor to U.S. president Donald Trump .
She has been a Republican Party campaign manager , strategist , and pollster , and was formerly president and CEO of The Polling Company Inc. / Woman Trend .
In 2016 , Conway endorsed Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primaries and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee , Keep the Promise I , which ran advertisements critical of then Republican candidate Donald Trump .
That July , Cruz had withdrawn from the race , and Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager to his campaign .
She was the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign .
On December 22 , 2016 , Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as Counselor to the President , serving alongside Steve Bannon , assistant to the President and White House chief strategist .
Since Trump 's inauguration , Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies , including using the phrase `` alternative facts '' , making reference to a `` Bowling Green massacre '' that never occurred , claiming Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed , and publicly endorsing commercial products associated with the president 's daughter Ivanka Trump .
As a result , a number of media outlets have called her credibility into question , with some refusing her requests for one-on-one interviews .
According to Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski , she is privately `` disgusted '' by her job and Donald Trump , and her words do not reflect her actual beliefs - though Conway disputed the claim .
