Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays Negan in the television series of the same name and first appeared in the series ' sixth season finale .
After Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors agree to begin a trading relationship with the Hilltop Colony , they are ambushed by the Saviors and are forced to obey Negan 's orders to give the Saviors half of their supplies , as the other communities do .
Initially obedient , Rick and the others secretly conspire with other communities in the Washington , D.C. area to prepare for war against the Saviors .
Negan resides in an abandoned factory , where most of the attractive women -- formerly other men 's girlfriends or wives -- act as his wives .
He soon grows fond of Rick 's son , Carl Grimes .
Morgan has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Negan in the television series , earning himself the Critics ' Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series .
After first being offered the role of Negan , Morgan immediately accepted the offer due to being a fan of The Walking Dead prior .
