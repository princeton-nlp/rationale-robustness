Maltese -LRB- links = no -RRB- is the national language of Malta and a co-official language of the country alongside English , while also serving as an official language of the European Union , the only Semitic language so distinguished .
Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic , the variety of Arabic that developed in Sicily and was later introduced to Malta , between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century .
Maltese is a unique branch of Arabic because it has evolved independently of Literary Arabic into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation .
The original Semitic base -LRB- Siculo-Arabic -RRB- comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary , especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words , but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian ; and English words make up between 6 % and 20 % of the vocabulary .
Maltese has always been written in the Latin script , the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages .
