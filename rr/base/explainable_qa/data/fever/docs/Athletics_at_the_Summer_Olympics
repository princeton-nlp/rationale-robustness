Athletics has been contested at every Summer Olympics since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics .
The athletics program traces its earliest roots to events used in the ancient Greek Olympics .
The modern program includes track and field events , road running events , and racewalking events .
Cross country running was also on the program in earlier editions but it was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics .
