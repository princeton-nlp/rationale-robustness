Donna Noble is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who .
Portrayed by British actress and comedian Catherine Tate , she is a companion of the Tenth Doctor -LRB- David Tennant -RRB- .
Originally appearing in the closing scene of the show 's 2006 series and as a special guest star in its following Christmas special , `` The Runaway Bride '' , Tate was not expected to reprise her role as Donna ; for series 3 -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , the Doctor travelled alongside medical student Martha Jones -LRB- Freema Agyeman -RRB- .
However , Tate expressed interest in returning to the role , and she returned as Donna for the duration of the series 4 -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , and in a subsequent 2009-10 Christmas and New Year 's special .
Within the series ' narrative , Donna begins as an outspoken Londoner in her mid-30s , a temp worker from Chiswick whose view of the universe is small in scope .
Although she at first finds alien time traveller the Doctor terrifying , their initial encounter leaves her unsatisfied with her normal life and she decides to travel alongside him when the next opportunity arises .
Donna becomes an asset to the Doctor on his adventures and it is she who ultimately saves the universe in the series 4 finale , although tragically at the cost of the memories of her travels with the Doctor .
In a contrast to the Tenth Doctor 's prior companions , who both harboured romantic feelings for him , Donna and the Doctor shared a strictly friendly relationship ; and she did not feel the need to prove herself to be allowed to travel with the Doctor , who refers to her as his `` best mate '' .
