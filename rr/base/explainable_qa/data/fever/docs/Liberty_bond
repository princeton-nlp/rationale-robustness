A Liberty bond -LRB- or liberty loan -RRB- was a war bond that was sold in the United States to support the allied cause in World War I. Subscribing to the bonds became a symbol of patriotic duty in the United States and introduced the idea of financial securities to many citizens for the first time .
The Act of Congress which authorized the Liberty Bonds is still used today as the authority under which all U.S. Treasury bonds are issued .
Securities , also known as Liberty Bonds , were issued in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to finance the rebuilding of the areas affected .
