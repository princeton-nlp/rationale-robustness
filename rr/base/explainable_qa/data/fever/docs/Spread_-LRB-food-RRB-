A spread is a food that is literally spread , generally with a knife , onto food products such as bread and crackers .
Spreads are added to food in order to enhance the flavor or texture of the food , which may be considered bland without it .
Spreads should be distinguished from dips , such as salsa , which are generally not applied to spread onto food but have food dipped into them instead .
Peanut butter is a typical example of spread .
Common spreads include dairy spreads -LRB- such as cheeses , creams , and butters -- although the term butter is broadly applied to many spreads -RRB- , honey , plant-derived spreads -LRB- such as jams , jellies , and hummus -RRB- , yeast spreads -LRB- such as vegemite and marmite -RRB- , and meat-based spreads -LRB- such as pâté -RRB- .
