Fiji Hindi or Fijian Hindi , known locally as `` Hindustani '' , is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by most Fijian citizens of Indian descent , though a small number speak other languages at home .
It is an Eastern Hindi language that has been subject to considerable influence by Awadhi , Bhojpuri , Magahi and other Bihari languages .
It has also borrowed a large number of words from the Fijian and English languages .
A large number of words , unique to Fiji Hindi , have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Fijians now live in .
First-generation Indians in Fiji , who used the language as a lingua franca in Fiji , referred to it as Fiji Baat , `` Fiji talk '' .
It is closely related to Caribbean Hindustani and the Hindustani spoken in Mauritius and South Africa .
