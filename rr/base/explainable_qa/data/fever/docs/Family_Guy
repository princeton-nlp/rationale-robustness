Family Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company .
The series centers on the Griffins , a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois ; their children Meg , Chris , and Stewie ; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian .
The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog , Rhode Island , and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture .
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films , The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve .
MacFarlane redesigned the films ' protagonist , Larry , and his dog , Steve , and renamed them Peter and Brian , respectively .
MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998 , and the show was greenlit and began production .
Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002 , Fox canceled the series , with one episode left unaired .
Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003 , finishing the series ' original run .
However , favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season , which began airing on May 1 , 2005 .
Since its debut on January 31 , 1999 , episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast .
Its fifteenth season began on September 25 , 2016 .
