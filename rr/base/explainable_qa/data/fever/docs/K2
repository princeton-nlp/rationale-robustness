K2 is the highest point of the Karakoram range and the highest point in both Pakistan and Xinjiang .
K2 is known as the Savage Mountain due to the extreme difficulty of ascent .
It has the second-highest fatality rate among the eight thousanders .
With around 300 successful summits and 77 fatalities , about one person dies on the mountain for every four who summit .
It is more difficult and hazardous to reach the peak of K2 from the Chinese side , so it is usually climbed from the Pakistani side .
