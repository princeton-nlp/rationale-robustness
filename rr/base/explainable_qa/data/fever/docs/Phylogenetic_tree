A phylogenetic tree or evolutionary tree is a branching diagram or `` tree '' showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities -- their phylogeny -- based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics .
The taxa joined together in the tree are implied to have descended from a common ancestor .
Phylogenetic trees are central to the field of phylogenetics .
In a phylogenetic tree , each node with descendants represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of the descendants , and the edge lengths in some trees may be interpreted as time estimates .
Each node is called a taxonomic unit .
Internal nodes are generally called hypothetical taxonomic units , as they can not be directly observed .
Trees are useful in fields of biology such as bioinformatics , systematics , and phylogenetic comparative methods .
Unrooted trees illustrate only the relatedness of the leaf nodes and do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred .
