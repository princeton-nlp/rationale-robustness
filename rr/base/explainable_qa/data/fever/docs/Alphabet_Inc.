Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate created in a corporate restructuring on October 2 , 2015 .
It is the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries .
The two founders of Google assumed executive roles in the new company , with Larry Page serving as CEO and Sergey Brin as President .
The company is based in Mountain View , California .
Alphabet 's portfolio encompasses several industries , including technology , life sciences , investment capital , and research .
Some of its subsidiaries include Google , Calico , GV , CapitalG , Verily , Waymo , X , and Google Fiber .
Some of the subsidiaries of Alphabet have altered their names since leaving Google -- Google Ventures becoming GV , Google Life Sciences becoming Verily and Google X becoming just X. Following the restructuring Page became CEO of Alphabet while Sundar Pichai took his position as CEO of Google .
Shares of Google 's stock have been converted into Alphabet stock , which trade under Google 's former ticker symbols of `` GOOG '' and `` GOOGL '' .
The establishment of Alphabet was prompted by a desire to make the core Google Internet services business `` cleaner and more accountable '' while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services .
