Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart -LRB- -LSB- ˈwʊlfɡæŋ_æməˈdeɪəs_ˈmoʊtsɑrt -RSB- ; -LSB- ˈvɔlfɡaŋ amaˈdeːʊs ˈmoːtsaʁt -RSB- ; 27 January 1756 -- 5 December 1791 -RRB- , baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart , was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era .
Born in Salzburg , he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood .
Already competent on keyboard and violin , he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty .
At 17 , Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court , but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position .
While visiting Vienna in 1781 , he was dismissed from his Salzburg position .
He chose to stay in the capital , where he achieved fame but little financial security .
During his final years in Vienna , he composed many of his best-known symphonies , concertos , and operas , and portions of the Requiem , which was largely unfinished at the time of his death .
The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized .
He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons .
He composed more than 600 works , many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic , concertante , chamber , operatic , and choral music .
He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers , and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music .
Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart , and Joseph Haydn wrote : `` posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years '' .
