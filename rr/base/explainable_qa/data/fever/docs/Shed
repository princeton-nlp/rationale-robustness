A shed is typically a simple , single-storey roofed structure in a back garden or on an allotment that is used for storage , hobbies , or as a workshop .
Sheds vary considerably in the complexity of their construction and their size , from small open-sided tin-roofed structures to large wood-framed sheds with shingled roofs , windows , and electrical outlets .
Sheds used on farms or in industry can be large structures .
The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame , plastic sheathing and frame , all-wood construction -LRB- the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin -RRB- , and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame .
A culture of shed enthusiasts exists in several countries for people who enjoy building sheds and spending time in them for relaxation .
In Australia and New Zealand there are magazines called The Shed , an association for shed hobbyists -LRB- the Australian Men 's Shed Association -RRB- , and a book entitled Men and Sheds .
