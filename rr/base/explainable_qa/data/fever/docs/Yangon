Yangon -LRB- ရန က န , MLCTS rankun mrui , -LSB- jàɴɡòʊɴ mjo̰ -RSB- ; formerly known as Rangoon , literally : `` End of Strife '' -RRB- is the capital of the Yangon Region of Myanmar , also known as Burma .
Yangon served as the capital of Myanmar until 2006 , when the military government relocated the capital to the purpose-built city of Naypyidaw in central Myanmar .
With over 7 million people , Yangon is Myanmar 's largest city and is its most important commercial centre .
Yangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in the region , and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact .
The colonial-era commercial core is centred around the Sule Pagoda , which reputed to be over 2,000 years old .
The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda -- Myanmar 's most sacred Buddhist pagoda .
The mausoleum of the last Mughal Emperor is located in Yangon , where he had been exiled following the Indian Mutiny of 1857 .
Yangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure , especially compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia .
Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon , most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure .
