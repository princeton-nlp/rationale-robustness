`` Tie Your Mother Down '' is a song by the British rock band Queen , written by lead guitarist Brian May .
It is the opening track and the second single from their 1976 album A Day at the Races .
On its original release as a single in 1977 the song peaked at 31 in the UK Singles Chart , however more than 20 years later it was released as a double a-side to `` No-One But You -LRB- Only the Good Die Young -RRB- '' where it reached 13 in UK Singles Chart .
On the album the song is preceded by a one-minute instrumental intro featuring a Shepard tone melody , which is reprised in the ending of `` Teo Torriatte '' : this was intended to create a `` circle '' in the album , typical , for example , of Pink Floyd 's albums .
After its release in 1976 , it was played by Queen on every subsequent tour .
At the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert , the song was co-performed by Queen and guests Joe Elliot and Slash .
On several occasions in the recent years , Brian May and Roger Taylor have played this song live with the Foo Fighters , including performances at Queen 's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2001 , and the VH1 Rock Honors in 2006 .
The song is a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero Live .
