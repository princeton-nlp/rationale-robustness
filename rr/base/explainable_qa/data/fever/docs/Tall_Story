Tall Story is a 1960 American romantic comedy film made by Warner Bros. , directed by Joshua Logan and starring Anthony Perkins with Jane Fonda , in her first screen role , at the age of 22 .
It is based on the 1957 novel `` The Homecoming Game '' by Howard Nemerov , which was the basis of a successful 1959 Broadway play , called Tall Story , by the writing team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse .
The film was a considerable departure from Logan 's previous two projects , the drama Sayonara , which won multiple Academy Awards , and the blockbuster South Pacific and was Robert Redford 's first film ever , where he played an uncredited basketball player .
Tall Story is a farcical social satire of American campus life , making fun of the way college life can become a marriage market for some students .
Fonda portrays a character who is the complete opposite of the independent liberated woman she later personified .
