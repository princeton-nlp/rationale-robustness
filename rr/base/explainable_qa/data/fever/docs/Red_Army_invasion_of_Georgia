The Red Army invasion of Georgia -LRB- 15 February -- 17 March 1921 -RRB- , also known as the Soviet -- Georgian War or the Soviet invasion of Georgia , was a military campaign by the Soviet Russian -LRB- RSFSR -RRB- Red Army aimed at overthrowing the Social-Democratic -LRB- Menshevik -RRB- government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia -LRB- DRG -RRB- and installing a Bolshevik regime in the country .
The conflict was a result of expansionist policy by the Soviets , who aimed to control as much as possible of the lands which had been part of the former Russian Empire until the turbulent events of the First World War , as well as the revolutionary efforts of mostly Russian-based Georgian Bolsheviks , who did not have sufficient support in their native country to seize power without external intervention .
The independence of Georgia had been recognized by Soviet Russia in the Treaty of Moscow , signed on 7 May 1920 , and the subsequent invasion of the country was not universally agreed upon in Moscow .
It was largely engineered by two influential Georgian-born Soviet Russian officials , Stalin -LRB- Dzhugashvili -RRB- and Sergo -LRB- Ordzhonikidze -RRB- , who on 14 February 1921 got the consent of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin to advance into Georgia , on the pretext of supporting `` peasants and workers rebellion '' in the country .
Soviet forces took the Georgian capital Tbilisi -LRB- then known as Tiflis to most non-Georgian speakers -RRB- after heavy fighting and declared the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic on 25 February 1921 .
The rest of the country was overrun within three weeks , but it was not until September 1924 that Soviet rule was firmly established .
Almost simultaneous occupation of a large portion of southwest Georgia by Turkey -LRB- February -- March 1921 -RRB- threatened to develop into a crisis between Moscow and Ankara , and led to significant territorial concessions by the Soviets to the Turkish National Government in the Treaty of Kars .
