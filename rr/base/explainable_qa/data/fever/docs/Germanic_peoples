The Germanic peoples -LRB- also called Teutonic , Suebian , or Gothic in older literature -RRB- are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group of Northern European origin .
They are identified by their use of Germanic languages , which diversified out of Proto-Germanic during the Pre-Roman Iron Age .
The term `` Germanic '' originated in classical times when groups of tribes living in Lower , Upper , and Greater Germania were referred to using this label by Roman scribes .
The Roman use of the term `` Germanic '' was not necessarily based upon language , but rather referred to the tribal groups and alliances that lived in the regions of modern-day Luxembourg , Belgium , Northern France , Alsace , the Netherlands , and Germany , and which were considered to be less civilized and more physically hardened than the Celtic Gauls .
Tribes referred to as `` Germanic '' by Roman authors generally lived to the north and east of the Gauls .
The Germanic tribes were chronicled by Rome 's historians as having had a critical impact on the course of Europe 's history during the Roman-Germanic wars , particularly at the historic Battle of the Teutoburg Forest , where Germanic tribal warriors under the leadership of the Cherusci chieftain Arminius routed three Roman legions and their auxiliaries , which precipitated the Roman Empire 's strategic withdrawal from Magna Germania .
