One by One is the fourth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters , released on October 22 , 2002 by RCA .
The album is the first to feature guitarist Chris Shiflett .
Production on the album was troubled , with initial recording sessions considered unsatisfying and raising tensions between the band members .
They eventually decided to redo the album from scratch during a two-week period at frontman Dave Grohl 's home studio in Alexandria , Virginia .
The songs on the album , which include the successful singles `` All My Life '' and `` Times Like These '' , have been noted for their introspective lyrics and a heavier and more aggressive sound compared to the band 's earlier work , which Grohl said was intended to translate the energy of the Foo Fighters ' live performances into a recording .
The album was a commercial success , topping the charts in Australia , Ireland and the United Kingdom and sold over one million copies in the United States .
One by One was positively received by critics , winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2004 -- the second Grammy Award for Best Rock Album won by the band -- and praised for its sound and production .
However , some considered the work inferior to the band 's previous albums , and the musicians themselves eventually grew distasteful of the record as a whole .
