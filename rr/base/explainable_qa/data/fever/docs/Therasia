Therasia , also known as Thirasía , is an island in the volcanic island group of Santorini in the Greek Cyclades .
It lies north-west of Nea Kameni , a small island formed in recent centuries by volcanic activity and thus marking the centre of the island group .
Therasia is the second largest island of the group , the largest by far being Thera .
Therasia has a land area of 9.299 km ² and its population was 319 inhabitants at the 2011 census .
It is part of the municipal unit of Oia .
Thera and Therasia were separated by the Thera eruption .
At Knossos , in a LMIIIA context -LRB- 14th century BC -RRB- , seven Linear B texts while calling upon `` all the gods '' make sure to grant primacy to an elsewhere-unattested entity called qe-ra-si-ja and , once , qe-ra-si-jo .
However this probably refers to a god or a person rather than to an island * Qherasia > Therasia .
Thirasia is also the book of Greek poet Dimitris Varos that became a music album and theatrical performance by Greek composer Giannis Markopoulos under the title Daring Communication - Electric Theseus .
