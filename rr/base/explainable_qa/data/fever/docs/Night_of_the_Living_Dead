The film became a financial success , grossing $ 12 million domestically and $ 18 million internationally .
It has been a cult classic ever since .
Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized at its release for its explicit gore .
It eventually garnered critical acclaim and has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry , as a film deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .
The story follows characters Ben -LRB- Jones -RRB- , Barbra -LRB- O'Dea -RRB- , and five others trapped in a rural farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania , which is attacked by a large and growing group of unnamed `` living dead '' monsters drawing on earlier depictions in popular culture of the ghoul , which has led this type of creature to be referred to most popularly as a zombie .
This is the most easily recognized version of the living dead , to the point where people gather in mass quantities for conventions dressed as zombies , complete with makeup and prosthetic limbs .
Night of the Living Dead led to five subsequent films between 1978 and 2010 , also directed by Romero , and inspired two remakes ; the most well-known remake was released in 1990 , directed by Tom Savini .
