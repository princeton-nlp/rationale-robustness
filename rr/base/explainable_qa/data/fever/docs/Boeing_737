The Boeing 737 is an American short - to medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner .
Originally developed as a shorter , lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from Boeing 's 707 and 727 , the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers .
The 737 is Boeing 's only narrow-body airliner in production , with the 737 Next Generation -LRB- -700 , -800 , and -900 ER -RRB- variants currently being built .
Production has also begun on the re-engined and redesigned 737 MAX , which is set to enter service in 2017 .
Originally envisioned in 1964 , the initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967 and entered airline service in February 1968 at Lufthansa .
Next , the lengthened 737-200 entered service in April 1968 .
In the 1980s Boeing launched the -300 , -400 , and -500 models , subsequently referred to as the Boeing 737 Classic series .
The 737 Classics added capacity and incorporated CFM56 turbofan engines along with wing improvements .
In the 1990s , Boeing introduced the 737 Next Generation , with multiple changes including a redesigned , increased span laminar flow wing , upgraded `` glass '' cockpit , and new interior .
The 737 Next Generation comprises the four -600 , -700 , -800 , and -900 models , ranging from 102 ft to 138 ft in length .
Boeing Business Jet versions of the 737 Next Generation are also produced .
The 737 series is the best-selling jet commercial airliner in history .
The 737 has been continuously manufactured by Boeing since 1967 with 9,486 aircraft delivered and 4,478 orders yet to be fulfilled .
Assembly of the 737 is performed at the Boeing Renton Factory in Renton , Washington .
Many 737s serve markets previously filled by 707 , 727 , 757 , DC-9 , and MD-80 / MD-90 airliners , and the aircraft currently competes primarily with the Airbus A320 family .
As of 2006 , there were an average of 1,250 Boeing 737s airborne at any given time , with two departing or landing somewhere every five seconds .
