The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago , when Bantu-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country .
Beginning in 1894 , the area was ruled as a protectorate by the British , who established administrative law across the territory .
Uganda gained independence from Britain on 9 October 1962 .
The period since then has been marked by intermittent conflicts , including a lengthy civil war against the Lord 's Resistance Army in the Northern Region , which has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties .
The official languages are English and Swahili , although `` any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative , administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law . ''
Luganda , a central language , is widely spoken across the country , and several other languages are also spoken including Runyoro , Runyankole , Rukiga , and Luo .
