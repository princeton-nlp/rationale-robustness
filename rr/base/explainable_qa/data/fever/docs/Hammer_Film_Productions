Hammer Film Productions is a British film production company based in London .
Founded in 1934 , the company is best known for a series of Gothic `` Hammer Horror '' films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s .
Hammer also produced science fiction , thrillers , film noir and comedies -- and , in later years , television series .
During its most successful years , Hammer dominated the horror film market , enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success .
This success was due , in part , to distribution partnerships with major United States studios , such as Warner Bros. .
During the late 1960s and 1970s the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula , with varying degrees of success .
The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s .
In 2000 , the studio was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi and publishing millionaires Neil Mendoza and William Sieghart .
The company announced plans to begin making films again after this , but none were produced .
In May 2007 , the company was sold again , this time to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoon John de Mol , who announced plans to spend some $ 50m -LRB- # 25m -RRB- on new horror films .
The new owners also acquired the Hammer group 's film library , consisting of 295 movies .
Simon Oakes , who took over as CEO of Hammer , said : `` Hammer is a great British brand -- we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential .
The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time '' .
Since then it has produced several films , including Let Me In -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , The Resident -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , The Woman in Black -LRB- 2012 -RRB- and The Quiet Ones -LRB- 2014 -RRB- .
