The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States consisting of two chambers : the Senate and the House of Representatives .
The Congress meets in the Capitol in Washington , D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election , though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment .
Members are usually affiliated to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party , and only rarely to a third party or as independents .
Congress has 535 voting members : 435 Representatives and 100 Senators .
The House of Representatives has six non-voting members in addition to its 435 voting members .
These members can , however , sit on congressional committees and introduce legislation .
These members represent Washington , D.C. , Puerto Rico , American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
The members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency , known as a `` district '' .
Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results , provided that each state has at least one congressional representative .
Each state , regardless of population or size , has two senators .
Currently , there are 100 senators representing the 50 states .
Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term , with terms staggered , so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election .
