Luxo Jr. is a 1986 American computer-animated short film produced by Pixar and directed by John Lasseter .
The two-minute short film revolves around one larger and one smaller desk lamp .
The larger lamp , named Luxo Sr. , looks on while the smaller , `` younger '' Luxo Jr. plays exuberantly with a ball that it accidentally deflates .
Luxo Jr. was Pixar 's first animation after Ed Catmull and John Lasseter left Industrial Light and Magic 's computer division .
It is the source of the hopping desk lamp included in Pixar 's corporate logo .
Lasseter 's aim was to finish the short film for the 1986 SIGGRAPH , an annual computer graphics conference attended by thousands of industry professionals .
The film would come from his experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp .
Lasseter worked to improve the story within the allotted two minutes .
In animation , the film demonstrates the use of shadow maps within the rendering software .
Lasseter applied classic animation principles defined by Disney 's Nine Old Men to convey the lamps ' emotions .
Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock , and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk , ready to work early the next morning .
In total it took about four and a half months to do .
The commitment paid off , and it was finished in time to be shown at SIGGRAPH .
Before Luxo Jr. finished playing at SIGGRAPH , the crowd had already risen in applause .
Luxo Jr. is regarded as a breakthrough in the animation medium as a whole , changing traditionalists ' interpretation of computer animation .
The short was the first work of animation to use procedural animation , the software written by Eben Ostby .
It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film , becoming the first CGI film nominated for an Academy Award .
In 2014 , Luxo Jr. was deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry .
