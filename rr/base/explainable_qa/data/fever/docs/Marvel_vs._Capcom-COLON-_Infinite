Marvel vs. Capcom : Infinite is an upcoming fighting video game in development by Capcom .
It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games .
Like previous installments , players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles .
Infinite features two-on-two fights , as opposed to the three-on-three format used in its preceding titles .
The series ' traditional character assists have been removed ; instead , the game incorporates a tag-based combo system , which allows players to form continuous combos between their two characters .
It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the Infinity Stones , which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected .
The game is planned for release in September 2017 for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Microsoft Windows .
Infinite was announced during Sony 's PlayStation Experience event in December 2016 .
Capcom initially lost the use of the Marvel license in 2012 , after The Walt Disney Company decided to focus on self-publishing its own gaming titles ; however , Capcom was able to reacquire the license after Disney scrapped their plans .
Infinite was designed to be more accessible than previous Marvel vs. Capcom games , resulting in departures from some series ' mainstays , such as assists .
The game will also feature a larger emphasis on storytelling , with its own cinematic story experience .
The plot follows the heroes and villains of the Marvel and Capcom universes , who must work together to save their merged worlds against a new threat , Ultron Sigma .
