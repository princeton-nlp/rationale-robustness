A staple food , or simply a staple , is a food that is eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion of a standard diet for a given people , supplying a large fraction of energy needs and generally forming a significant proportion of the intake of other nutrients as well .
The staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal , and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of staples .
Staple foods vary from place to place , but typically they are inexpensive or readily-available foods that supply one or more of the three organic macronutrients needed for survival and health : carbohydrates , proteins , and fats .
Typical examples of staples include tubers and roots ; and grains , legumes , and other seeds .
Early agricultural civilizations valued the foods that they established as staples because , in addition to providing necessary nutrition , they generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay .
Such nonperishable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage , such as dry seasons or cold temperate winters , against which times harvests have been stored .
During seasons of plenty , wider choices of foods may be available .
Main staple foods are derived either from vegetals and animal products , including cereals -LRB- such as rice , wheat , maize , millet , or sorghum -RRB- , starchy tubers or root vegetables -LRB- such as potatoes , cassava , yams , or taro -RRB- , meat , fish , eggs , milk , and cheese .
Other staple foods include pulses -LRB- dried legumes -RRB- , sago -LRB- derived from the pith of the sago palm tree -RRB- , and fruits -LRB- such as breadfruit and plantains -RRB- .
Staple foods may also contain -LRB- depending on the region -RRB- : olive oil , coconut oil and sugar -LRB- e.g. from plantains -RRB- .
