The Musée National d'Art Moderne -LRB- -LSB- myze nasjɔnal daʁ mɔdɛʁn -RSB- , National Museum of Modern Art -RRB- is the national museum for modern art of France .
It is located in Paris and is housed in the Centre Pompidou in the 4th arrondissement of the city .
It is among the most visited art museums in the world and one of the largest for modern and contemporary art .
In 1937 , the Musée National d'Art Moderne succeeded the Musée du Luxembourg , established in 1818 by King Louis XVIII as the first museum of contemporary art created in Europe , devoted to living artists whose work was due to join the Louvre 10 years after their death .
Imagined as early as 1929 by Auguste Perret to replace the old Palais du Trocadero , the construction of a museum of modern art was officially decided in 1934 in the western wing of the Palais de Tokyo .
Completed in 1937 for that year 's International Exhibition of Arts and Technology , it was temporarily used for another purpose , since the exhibition of national and foreign art indépendant was then preferably held in the Petit Palais and the Musée du Jeu de Paume .
Although due to open in 1939 , construction was eventually interrupted by the war ; following the nomination of its first Chief Conservator in September 1940 , the museum partially opened in 1942 with only a third of the collection brought back from some national collection caches hidden in the province .
But its real inauguration did n't take place until 1947 , after World War II and the addition of the foreign schools collection of the Musée du Luxembourg , which had been held at the Musée du Jeu de Paume since 1922 .
In 1947 , then housed in the Palais de Tokyo , its collection was dramatically increased by its first director , Jean Cassou , thanks to his special relationship with many prominent artists or their families , such as Picasso and Braque .
With the creation of the Centre Pompidou , the museum moved to its current location in 1977 .
The museum has the second largest collection of modern and contemporary art in the world , after the Museum of Modern Art in New York , with more than 100,000 works of art by 6,400 artists from 90 countries since Fauvism in 1905 .
These works include painting , sculpture , drawing , print , photography , cinema , new media , architecture , and design .
A part of the collection is exhibited every two years alternately in an 18500 m2 space divided between two floors , one for modern art -LRB- from 1905 to 1960 , on the 5th floor -RRB- , the other for contemporary art -LRB- from 1960 , on the 4th floor -RRB- , and 5 exhibition halls , on a total of 28000 m2 within the museum .
The Atelier Brancusi is located in its own building adjacent to the Centre Pompidou .
The works displayed in the museum often change in order to show to the public the variety and depth of the collection .
Many major temporary exhibitions of modern and contemporary art have taken place on a separate floor -LRB- the 6th -RRB- over the years , among them many one-person exhibitions .
Since 2010 , the museum has also displayed unique , temporary exhibitions in its provincial branch , the Centre Pompidou-Metz , in a 10000 m2 space divided between 3 galleries and since 2011 , in a small mobile museum touring the province .
