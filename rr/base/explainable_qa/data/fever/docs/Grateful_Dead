The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto , California .
Ranging from quintet to septet , the band is known for its unique and eclectic style , which fused elements of rock , psychedelia , experimental music , modal jazz , country , folk , bluegrass , blues , reggae , and space rock , for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams , and for their devoted fan base , known as `` Deadheads '' .
`` Their music , '' writes Lenny Kaye , `` touches on ground that most other groups do n't even know exists . ''
These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead `` the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world '' .
The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue .
The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8 , 1977 performance at Cornell University 's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012 .
The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide .
