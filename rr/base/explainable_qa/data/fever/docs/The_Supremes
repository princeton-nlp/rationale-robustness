The Supremes were an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s .
Founded as the Primettes in Detroit , Michigan , in 1959 , the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown 's acts and are , to date , America 's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown 's main songwriting and production team , Holland -- Dozier -- Holland .
At their peak in the mid-1960s , the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity , and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success .
Founding members Florence Ballard , Mary Wilson , Diana Ross , and Betty McGlown , all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit , formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes -LRB- with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks , who went on to form the Temptations -RRB- .
Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960 , and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes .
Martin left the act in early 1962 , and Ross , Ballard , and Wilson carried on as a trio .
During the mid-1960s , the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer .
In 1967 , Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes , and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong .
Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell , at which point the group 's name reverted to the Supremes .
After 1972 , the lineup changed more frequently ; Lynda Laurence , Scherrie Payne , and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s .
The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after 18 years .
