Cheaper by the Dozen is a 2003 American family comedy film which takes its title from the autobiographical book of the same name by Frank B. Gilbreth , Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey , but despite the title and the concept of a family with twelve children , ranging from 5 year old Nigel & Kyle to 22 year old Nora , the film bears no resemblance to the book nor its original film adaptation , although it is mentioned that the mother 's maiden name is Gilbreth .
The film was directed by Shawn Levy , narrated by Bonnie Hunt , and starring Steve Martin .
The film was released on December 25 , 2003 by 20th Century Fox , ultimately grossing just over $ 190 million worldwide .
