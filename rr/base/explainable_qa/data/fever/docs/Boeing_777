The Boeing 777 is a family of long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliners developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes .
It is the world 's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 396 passengers , with a range of 5240 to .
Commonly referred to as the `` Triple Seven '' , its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft , six wheels on each main landing gear , fully circular fuselage cross-section , and a blade-shaped tail cone .
Developed in consultation with eight major airlines , the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between Boeing 's 767 and 747 .
As Boeing 's first fly-by-wire airliner , it has computer-mediated controls .
It was also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design .
The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths .
The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995 , followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997 .
The stretched 777-300 , which is 33.25 ft longer , followed in 1998 .
The initial 777-200 , -200 ER and -300 versions are equipped with General Electric GE90 , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines .
The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively , while the 777F , a freighter version , debuted in February 2009 ; these variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips .
The 777-200LR is the world 's longest-range airliner , able to fly more than halfway around the globe , and holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft .
The 777 first entered commercial service with United Airlines on June 7 , 1995 .
It has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner ; as of April 2017 , 60 customers had placed orders for 1,911 aircraft of all variants , with 1,484 delivered .
The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 725 delivered and 815 orders ; Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet , with 157 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2016 .
The 777 has been involved in six hull losses as of October 2016 ; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service .
The 777 ranks as one of Boeing 's best-selling models .
Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes .
Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300 , the Airbus A350 XWB , and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 .
The 787 Dreamliner , which entered service in 2011 , shares design features and a common type rating for pilots with the 777 .
In November 2013 , Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants , collectively named 777X , featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787 .
The new 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020 .
