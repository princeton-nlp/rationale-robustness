Don José María Chacón -LRB- 1 January 1749 -- 1 January 1833 -RRB- was the last Spanish Governor of Trinidad .
He was responsible for signing the Cedula of Population in 1783 -LRB- which led to extensive French immigration to Trinidad -RRB- , founded the city of San Fernando in 1784 and surrendered the island of Trinidad to a British fleet under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1797 .
The King of Spain set up a `` Council of War '' to look into the surrender .
By Royal Decree , Chacon and Rear Admiral Sebastián Ruiz de Apodaca -LRB- who had scuttled his small fleet -RRB- were banished for life from the `` Royal Domain . ''
Apodaca 's case was reconsidered and he was reinstated in 1809 , but Chacón died in exile .
