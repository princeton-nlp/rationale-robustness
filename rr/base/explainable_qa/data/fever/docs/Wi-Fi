Wi-Fi or WiFi is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards .
Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance , which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing .
Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers , video-game consoles , smartphones , digital cameras , tablet computers , digital audio players and modern printers .
Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point .
Such an access point -LRB- or hotspot -RRB- has a range of about 20 m indoors and a greater range outdoors .
Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves , or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points .
Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 GHz UHF and 5 GHz SHF ISM radio bands .
Having no physical connections , it is more vulnerable to attack than wired connections , such as Ethernet .
