In later times , Athena was syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva .
Athena was portrayed as having a calm temperament , and moving slowly to anger .
She was believed to only fight for just causes and never fight without a purpose .
In ancient Greek literature , Athena is portrayed as the astute companion of heroes and as the patron goddess of heroic endeavour .
She is also the patroness of Athens .
The Athenians constructed the Parthenon atop their Acropolis as a temple to Athena ; it takes its name from her epithet Parthenos , which means `` Virgin '' .
Veneration of Athena was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes .
