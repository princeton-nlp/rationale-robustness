The Raven is a 2012 American psychological thriller drama film directed by James McTeigue , produced by Marc D. Evans , Trevor Macy and Aaron Ryder and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare .
It stars John Cusack , Alice Eve , Brendan Gleeson and Luke Evans .
Set in 1849 , it is a fictionalized account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe 's life , in which the poet and author pursues a serial killer whose murders mirror those in Poe 's stories .
While the plot of the film is fictional , the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe 's mysterious death .
Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name `` Reynolds '' on the night before his death , though it is unclear to whom he was referring .
The title derives from Poe 's poem `` The Raven '' , in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated 1935 and 1963 films .
It was released in Canada , Ireland , and the United Kingdom on March 9 , 2012 and in the United States on April 27 , 2012 .
It was a moderate commercial success , receiving $ 1.7 million more than its budget , but garnering near-negative reviews , with the visual effects and score by Lucas Vidal praised , but the performances and plot twists criticized .
