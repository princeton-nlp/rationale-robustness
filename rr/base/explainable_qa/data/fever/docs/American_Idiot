Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s with a string of successful albums .
Following disappointing sales of their sixth album , Warning -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , the band took a break before recording their next album , titled Cigarettes and Valentines .
The recording process was cut short when the album 's master tapes were stolen .
Rather than re-record that material , the group decided to start over .
A concept album and the world 's first `` punk rock opera , '' American Idiot follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia , an adolescent anti-hero who is divided between `` rage and love . ''
Through its plot , the album expresses the disillusionment and dissent of a generation that came of age in a period shaped by many tumultuous events like the Iraq War .
The album was inspired by several musicals and the work of The Who .
Recording of American Idiot was split between two California studios between 2003 and 2004 .
Its album art depicts a heart-shaped hand grenade .
American Idiot marked a career comeback for Green Day following a period of decreased success .

The album spawned five successful singles : `` American Idiot '' , `` Boulevard of Broken Dreams '' , `` Holiday '' , `` Wake Me Up When September Ends '' and `` Jesus of Suburbia '' .
American Idiot was well received critically and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2005 .
Its success inspired a Broadway musical and an incomplete feature film adaptation .
It has been praised in the years following its release , appearing on several year-end and decade-end lists .
