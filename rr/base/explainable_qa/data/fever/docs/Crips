For `` Crip theory '' , see Disability studies .
The Crips are a primarily African-American gang .
They were founded in Los Angeles , California in 1969 mainly by Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams .
What was once a single alliance between two autonomous gangs is now a loosely connected network of individual sets , often engaged in open warfare with one another .
Its members traditionally wear blue clothing , a practice that has waned somewhat due to police crackdowns on gang members .
The Crips are one of the largest and most violent associations of street gangs in the United States , with an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 members in 2008 .
They have been involved in murders , robberies and drug dealing , among other crimes .
Crips have a long and bitter rivalry with the Bloods .
