The Plantation era , also loosely referred to as the Antebellum era , was a period in the history of the Southern United States , from the late 18th century until the start of the American Civil War in 1861 -LRB- which ended slavery in the United States and destroyed much of the economic landscape of the South -RRB- , marked by the economic growth of the South , based on slave-driven plantation farming .
Much of the economic growth of this era can be attributed to the rise of the plantation system and the use of slave labor , which many historians believe to be responsible for the economic woes of the South during the Reconstruction Era .
The concurrent rise in large-scale farming and in plantation slavery has led to studies on the institution of slavery as an economic system .
The plantation system eventually grew to form the industrial and social frame of government in the Southern slave states , while the associated institution of slavery became the basis of the Southern social system , ideology , and a set of psychological patterns .
