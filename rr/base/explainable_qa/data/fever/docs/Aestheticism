Aestheticism -LRB- also the Aesthetic Movement -RRB- is an intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature , fine art , music and other arts .
This meant that Art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning - ` Art for Art 's sake ' .
It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century , supported by notable figures such as Oscar Wilde , but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement , such as Harold Bloom , who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works , which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the last century .
In the 19th century , it was related to other movements such as symbolism or decadence represented in France , or decadentismo represented in Italy , and may be considered the British version of the same style .
