A role-playing game -LRB- sometimes spelled roleplaying game and abbreviated to RPG -RRB- is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting .
Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development .
Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines .
There are several forms of RPG .
The original form , sometimes called the tabletop RPG , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role-playing games -LRB- LARP -RRB- players physically perform their characters actions .
In both of these forms , an arranger called a game master -LRB- GM -RRB- usually decides on the rules and setting to be used , acting as referee , while each of the other players plays the role of a single character .
Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media , such as multi-player text-based MUDs and their graphics-based successors , massively multiplayer online role-playing games -LRB- MMORPGs -RRB- .
Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests , and may include capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics .
These games often share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling .
Despite this variety of forms , some game forms such as trading card games and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be included .
Role-playing activity may sometimes be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus .
The term is also sometimes used to describe roleplay simulation games and exercises used in teaching , training , and academic research .
