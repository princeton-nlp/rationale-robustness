Species distribution is the manner in which a biological taxon is spatially arranged .
Species distribution is not to be confused with dispersal , which is the movement of individuals away from their area of origin or from centers of high on density .
A similar concept is the species range .
A species range is often represented with a species range map .
Biogeographers try to understand the factors determining a species ' distribution .
The pattern of distribution is not permanent for each species .
Distribution patterns can change seasonally , in response to the availability of resources , and also depending on the scale at which they are viewed .
Dispersion usually takes place at the time of reproduction .
Populations within a species are translocated through many methods , including dispersal by people , wind , water and animals .
Humans are one of the largest distributors due to the current trends in globalization and the expanse of the transportation industry .
For example , large tankers often fill their ballasts with water at one port and empty them in another , causing a wider distribution of aquatic species .
Biogeography is the study of the distribution of biodiversity over space and time .
It is very useful in understanding species distribution through factors such as speciation , extinction , continental drift , glaciation , variation of sea levels , river capture and available resources .
This branch of study not only gives a description of the species distribution , but also a geographical explanation for the distribution of particular species .
The traditional biogeographic regions were first modeled by Alfred Wallace in The Geographical Distribution of Animals -LRB- 1876 -RRB- .
These were based on the work of Sclater 's terrestrial biogeographic regions .
Wallace 's system was based on both birds and vertebrates , including non-flying mammals , which better reflect the natural divisions of the Earth due to their limited dispersal abilities .
