The Icelandic Coast Guard -LRB- , Landhelgisgæslan or simply Gæslan -RRB- is the service responsible for Iceland 's coastal defense and maritime and aeronautical search and rescue .
Its origins can be traced to 1859 , when the corvette Ørnen started patrolling Icelandic waters .
In 1906 , Iceland 's first purposely built guard-ship , Islands Falk , began operation .
Iceland 's own defense of its territorial waters began around 1920 and the Icelandic Coast Guard was formally founded on July 1 , 1926 .
The first cannon was put on the trawler Thor in 1924 and on June 23 , 1926 the first ship built for the Coast Guard , named Óðinn , arrived in Iceland .
Three years later , on the 14 July 1929 the coastal defence ship Ægir was added to the Coast Guard fleet .
The Icelandic Coast Guard played its largest role during the Cod Wars between 1972 and 1975 , when the Coast Guard ships would cut the trawl wires of British and West German trawlers and engaged in confrontations with Royal Navy warships , in order to enforce a disputed expansion on Icelandic fishing territory .
The Coast Guard also maintains the Iceland Air Defence System which conducts ground surveillance of Iceland 's air space .
