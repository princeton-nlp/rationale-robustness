Franchising is the practice of the right to use a firm 's business model and brand for a prescribed period of time .
The word `` franchise '' is of Anglo-French derivation -- from franc , meaning free -- and is used both as a noun and as a -LRB- transitive -RRB- verb .
For the franchisor , the franchise is an alternative to building `` chain stores '' to distribute goods that avoids the investments and liability of a chain .
The franchisor 's success depends on the success of the franchisees .
The franchisee is said to have a greater incentive than a direct employee because they have a direct stake in the business .
Thirty-three countries -- including the United States and Australia -- have laws that explicitly regulate franchising , with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising .
Franchising is also used as a foreign market entry mode .
