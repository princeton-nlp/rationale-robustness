The Winds of Winter is the forthcoming sixth novel in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin .
The previous installment , A Dance with Dragons , covered less story than Martin intended , excluding at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliffhangers .
Martin intends to resolve these storylines `` very early '' in The Winds of Winter , saying `` I 'm going to open with the two big battles that I was building up to , the battle in the ice and the battle at Meereen -- the battle of Slaver 's Bay .
And then take it from there . ''
A Victarion Greyjoy chapter will begin five minutes after the end of A Dance with Dragons , taking place on the eve of the Iron Islanders ' arrival in Slaver 's Bay .
Arianne Martell sample chapters that Martin released on his website showed her heading for Griffin 's Roost to see the young man who is calling himself Aegon .
Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books , and that the Others will appear in the book .
