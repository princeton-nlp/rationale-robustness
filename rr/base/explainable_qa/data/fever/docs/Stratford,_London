Stratford is a district of east London , England , within the London Borough of Newham .
The area was part of the Ancient Parish and subsequent County Borough of West Ham , which became the western half of the modern borough in 1965 .
Historically an agrarian settlement in the county of Essex , Stratford was transformed into an industrial suburb following the introduction of the railway in 1839 .
The late 20th Century was a period of severe economic decline , eventually reversed by regeneration associated with the 2012 Summer Olympics , for which Stratford 's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was the principal venue .
Stratford is now East London 's primary retail , cultural and leisure centre .
It has also become the second most significant -LRB- after Canary Wharf -RRB- business location in the east of the capital .
