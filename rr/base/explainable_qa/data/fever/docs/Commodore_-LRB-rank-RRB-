Commodore is a naval rank used in many navies that is superior to a navy captain , but below a rear admiral .
Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of flotilla admiral or counter admiral or senior captain as an equivalent , although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral .
Traditionally , `` commodore '' is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time , even temporarily , much as `` captain '' is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer 's official title in the service is a lower rank .
As an official rank , a commodore typically commands a flotilla or squadron of ships as part of a larger task force or naval fleet commanded by an admiral .
A commodore 's ship is typically designated by the flying of a Broad pennant , as opposed to an admiral 's flag .
It is often regarded as a one-star rank with a NATO code of OF-6 -LRB- which is known in the U.S. as `` rear admiral -LRB- lower half -RRB- '' -RRB- , but whether it is regarded as a flag rank varies between countries .
It is sometimes abbreviated : as `` Cdre '' in British Royal Navy , `` CDRE '' in the US Navy , `` Cmdre '' in the Royal Canadian Navy , `` COMO '' in the Spanish Navy and in some navies speaking the Spanish language , or `` CMDE '' as used in the Indian Navy or in some other Navies .
