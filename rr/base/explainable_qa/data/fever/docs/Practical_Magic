Raised by their aunts after their parents ' death , the sisters grew up in a household that was anything but typical -- their aunts fed them chocolate cake for breakfast and taught them the uses of practical magic .
But the invocation of the Owens ' sorcery also carries a price -- some call it a curse : the men they fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death .
Now adult women with very different personalities , the quiet Sally and the fiery Gillian must use all of their powers to fight the family curse and a swarm of supernatural forces that could take away all the Owens ' lives .
