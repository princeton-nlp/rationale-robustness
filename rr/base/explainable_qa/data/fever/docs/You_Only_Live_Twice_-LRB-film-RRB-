You Only Live Twice -LRB- 1967 -RRB- is the fifth spy film in the James Bond series , and the fifth to star Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond .
The film 's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl , and loosely based on Ian Fleming 's 1964 novel of the same name .
It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming 's plot , using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story .
In the film , Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit .
With each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War , Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld , the head of SPECTRE .
The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld , who was previously a partially unseen character .
SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power , implied to be the People 's Republic of China , to provoke war between the superpowers .
During the filming in Japan , it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond , but after a hiatus , he returned in 1971 's Diamonds Are Forever and later 1983 's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again .
You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert , who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker , both starring Roger Moore .
You Only Live Twice was a great success , receiving positive reviews and grossing over $ 111 million in worldwide box office .
