Human trafficking is the trade of humans , most commonly for the purpose of forced labour , sexual slavery , or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others .
This may encompass providing a spouse in the context of forced marriage , or the extraction of organs or tissues , including for surrogacy and ova removal .

Human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim 's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation .
Human trafficking is the trade in people , especially women and children , and does not necessarily involve the movement of the person from one place to another .
