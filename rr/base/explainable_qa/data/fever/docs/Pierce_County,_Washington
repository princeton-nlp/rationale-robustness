Formed out of Thurston County on December 22 , 1852 , by the legislature of Oregon Territory , it was named for U.S. President Franklin Pierce .
Pierce County is in the Seattle metropolitan area -LRB- formally the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue , WA metropolitan statistical area -RRB- .
Pierce County is notable for being home to Mount Rainier , the tallest mountain and a volcano in the Cascade Range .
Its most recent recorded eruption was between 1820 and 1854 .
There is no imminent risk of eruption , but geologists expect that the volcano will erupt again .
If this should happen , parts of Pierce County and the Puyallup Valley would be at risk from lahars , lava , or pyroclastic flows .
The Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System was established in 1998 to assist in the evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in case of eruption .
