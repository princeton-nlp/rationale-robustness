The Good German is a 2006 film adaptation of Joseph Kanon 's eponymous 2001 novel .
It was directed by Steven Soderbergh , and stars George Clooney , Cate Blanchett , and Tobey Maguire .
Set in Berlin following the Allied victory over the Nazis , it begins as a murder mystery but weaves in elements involving the American postwar employment of Nazi rocket scientists in Operation Paperclip .
The film was shot in black-and-white and is designed to imitate the appearance of film noir from the 1940s , although it also includes material -- such as sex scenes and swearing -- that would have been prohibited by the Production Code .
Its poster is an homage to the poster for the classic film Casablanca -LRB- 1942 , also a Warner Bros. film -RRB- , as is the closing scene at an airport .
The DVD release presents the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio which declined in use from about 1953 , though the theatrical release used the slightly more modern but still unusual 1.66:1 ratio .
The film received mixed reviews and grossed $ 5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $ 32 million .
