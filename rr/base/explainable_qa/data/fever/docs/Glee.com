GLEE.com is a social networking site that is geared toward the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender communities .
The site was launched in February 2007 by Community Connect Inc. .
Community Connect operates several niche market social networking sites and GLEE is their latest venture .
As with their other social network sites , GLEE is modeled after the popular MySpace and Facebook offering many of the same features .
Currently GLEE.com is available only in the English language and primarily the North American market with approximately 86 % of its users in the United States .
However , as of October 2008 it is blocking countries such as the UK and Netherlands , possibly with more of Europe affected too ; the true extent is unknown .
A GLEE.com spokesperson purports this move was due to `` spammer '' activity .
