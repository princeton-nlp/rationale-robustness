The Simpsons has gone on to become the longest-running U.S. primetime-television series in history , as well as the longest-running animated series and sitcom .
Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978 .
At its peak , the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers .
Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks .
In 1985 , Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show .
Originally , Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show .
Fearing the loss of ownership rights , Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family , the Simpson family , and named the members after his own parents and sisters -- while Bart was an anagram of the word brat .
The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons , which has since aired episodes .
In 1997 , Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama , an animated series about life in the year 3000 , which premiered in 1999 , running for four years on Fox , then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons .
Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards , ten for The Simpsons and two for Futurama as well as a British Comedy Award for `` outstanding contribution to comedy '' in 2004 .
In 2002 , he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on Life in Hell .
