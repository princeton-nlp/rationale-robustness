Innovation can be defined simply as a `` new idea , device or method '' .
However , innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements , unarticulated needs , or existing market needs .
This is accomplished through more-effective products , processes , services , technologies , or business models that are readily available to markets , governments and society .
The term `` innovation '' can be defined as something original and more effective and , as a consequence , new , that `` breaks into '' the market or society .
It is related to , but not the same as , invention .
Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process .
The opposite of innovation is exnovation .
While a novel device is often described as an innovation , in economics , management science , and other fields of practice and analysis , innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society .
In industrial economics , innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing consumer demand .
