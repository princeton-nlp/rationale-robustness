Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them .
The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts -LRB- literary , visual , musical and performing arts -RRB- .
In the visual arts , to appropriate means to properly adopt , borrow , recycle or sample aspects -LRB- or the entire form -RRB- of human-made visual culture .
Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp .
Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work recontextualizes whatever it borrows to create the new work .
In most cases the original ` thing ' remains accessible as the original , without change .
