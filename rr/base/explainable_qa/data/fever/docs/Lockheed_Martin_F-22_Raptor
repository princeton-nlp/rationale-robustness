The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation , single-seat , twin-engine , all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force -LRB- USAF -RRB- .
The result of the USAF 's Advanced Tactical Fighter program , the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter , but also has ground attack , electronic warfare , and signal intelligence capabilities .
The prime contractor , Lockheed Martin , built most of the F-22 's airframe and weapons systems and did its final assembly , while Boeing provided the wings , aft fuselage , avionics integration , and training systems .
The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A -22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A .
After a protracted development and despite operational issues , the USAF considers the F-22 critical to its tactical air power , and says that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter .
The Raptor 's combination of stealth , aerodynamic performance , and situational awareness gives the aircraft unprecedented air combat capabilities .
The high cost of the aircraft , a lack of clear air-to-air missions due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs , a ban on exports , and development of the more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production .
A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009 , and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012 .
