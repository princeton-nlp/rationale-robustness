In a Lonely Place is a 1950 film noir directed by Nicholas Ray , and starring Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame , produced for Bogart 's Santana Productions .
The script was adapted by Edmund North from the 1947 novel of the same name by Dorothy B. Hughes .
Bogart stars as Dixon Steele , a troubled screenwriter suspected of murder and Grahame co-stars as Laurel Gray , a neighbor who falls under his spell .
Beyond its surface plot of confused identity and tormented love , the story is a mordant comment on Hollywood mores and the pitfalls of celebrity and near-celebrity , similar to two other American films released that same year ; Billy Wilder 's Sunset Boulevard and Joseph Mankiewicz 's All About Eve .
Although lesser known than his other work , Bogart 's performance is considered by many critics to be among his finest and the film 's reputation has grown over time along with Ray 's .
It is now considered a classic film noir , as evidenced by its inclusion on the Time magazine `` All-Time 100 List '' as well as Slant Magazine 's 100 Essential Films .
In 2007 , In a Lonely Place was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . ''
