The stratosphere -LRB- -LSB- ˈstrætəˌsfɪər , _ - toʊ - -RSB- -RRB- is the second major layer of Earth 's atmosphere , just above the troposphere , and below the mesosphere .
About 20 % of the atmosphere 's mass is contained in the stratosphere .
The stratosphere is stratified in temperature , with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the Earth .
The increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the Sun 's ultraviolet radiation by the ozone .
This is in contrast to the troposphere , near the Earth 's surface , where temperatures decreases with altitude .
The border between the troposphere and stratosphere , the tropopause , marks where this temperature inversion begins .
Near the equator , the stratosphere starts at 18 km ; at mid latitudes , it starts at 10 - and ends at 50 km ; at the poles , it starts at about 8 km .
Temperatures vary within the stratosphere with the seasons , in particular with the polar night -LRB- winter -RRB- .
The greatest variation of temperature takes place over the poles in the lower stratosphere ; those variations are largely steady at lower latitudes and higher altitudes .
