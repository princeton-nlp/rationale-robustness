Crystal Palace Football Club is a professional football club based in South Norwood , London , that plays in the Premier League , the top tier of English football .
The club was founded in 1905 at the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium which was situated inside its historic grounds .
Palace played their home games at the Cup Final venue until 1915 when the First World War forced them to move out and play at Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest .
In 1924 , the club moved to their current home at Selhurst Park .
Palace have been FA Cup finalists twice , in 1990 and 2016 , losing to Manchester United on both occasions .
Palace were one of the original founding members of the Premier League .
The club enjoyed their best ever top flight season in 1990 -- 91 , when they challenged for the English league title , eventually finishing in third place in the top tier , their highest ever league position .
Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season due to the partial UEFA ban on English clubs following the Heysel Stadium disaster .
The club have been second tier champions twice and hold the record for the most play-off wins for promotion to the top flight , winning the final four times .
Palace were also winners of the Full Members Cup in 1991 when they beat Everton in the Wembley final .
In 1973 , the club changed its original nickname from `` The Glaziers '' to `` The Eagles '' and introduced the red and blue vertical stripes now associated with the club .
