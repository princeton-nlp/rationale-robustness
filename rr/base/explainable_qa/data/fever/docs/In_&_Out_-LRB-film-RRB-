In & Out is a 1997 American romantic comedy film directed by Frank Oz and starring Kevin Kline , Tom Selleck , Joan Cusack , Matt Dillon , Debbie Reynolds , and Wilford Brimley .
It is an original story by screenwriter Paul Rudnick .
Joan Cusack was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance .
The film was inspired by Tom Hanks 's tearful speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar -LRB- for his role in Philadelphia -RRB- , in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach Rawley Farnsworth , and his former classmate John Gilkerson , `` two of the finest gay Americans , two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with . ''
The film became one of mainstream Hollywood 's few attempts at a comedic `` gay movie '' of its era , and was widely noted at the time for a 12-second kiss between Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck .
