Arthur Schopenhauer -LRB- -LSB- ˈaɐ̯tʊɐ̯ ˈʃoːpm̩ˌhaʊ̯ɐ -RSB- ; 22 February 1788 -- 21 September 1860 -RRB- was a German philosopher .
He is best known for his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation -LRB- expanded in 1844 -RRB- , wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will .
Proceeding from the transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant , Schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism , rejecting the contemporaneous post-Kantian philosophies of German idealism .
Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy -LRB- e.g. , asceticism , the world-as-appearance -RRB- , having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work .
His writing on aesthetics , morality , and psychology would exert important influence on thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries .
Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life , Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines , including philosophy , literature , and science .
Those who have cited his influence include Friedrich Nietzsche , Richard Wagner , Leo Tolstoy , Ludwig Wittgenstein , Erwin Schrödinger , Otto Rank , Gustav Mahler , Joseph Campbell , Albert Einstein , Carl Jung , Thomas Mann , Jorge Luis Borges , and Samuel Beckett , among others .
