The Saturn Corporation , also known as Saturn LLC , is a registered trademark established on January 7 , 1985 , as a subsidiary of General Motors .
The company marketed itself as a `` different kind of car company '' and operated somewhat independently from its parent company for a time with its own assembly plant in Spring Hill , Tennessee ; unique models ; and a separate retailer network , and was GM 's attempt to compete with Japanese automakers .
Following the withdrawal of a bid by Penske Automotive to acquire Saturn in September 2009 , General Motors discontinued the Saturn brand and ended its outstanding franchises on October 31 , 2010 .
All new production was halted on October 7 , 2009 .
