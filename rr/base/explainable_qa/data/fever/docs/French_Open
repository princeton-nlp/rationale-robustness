The French Open , often referred to as Roland-Garros -LRB- -LSB- ʁɔlɑ̃ ɡaʁɔs -RSB- -RRB- , is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris , France .
Named after the French aviator Roland Garros , it is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments , the other three being the Australian Open , Wimbledon and the US Open .
Roland Garros is currently the only major held on clay , and it is the zenith of the spring clay court season .
Because of the seven rounds needed for a championship , the slow-playing surface and the best-of-five-set men 's singles matches -LRB- without a tiebreak in the final set -RRB- , the event is widely considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world .
