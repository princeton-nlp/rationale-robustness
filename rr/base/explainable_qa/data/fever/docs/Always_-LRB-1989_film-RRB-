Always is a 1989 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Richard Dreyfuss , Holly Hunter , John Goodman , introducing Brad Johnson , and featuring Audrey Hepburn 's cameo in her final film appearance .
It is a remake of the 1943 romantic drama A Guy Named Joe , although Spielberg did not treat the film as a direct scene-by-scene repeat of the earlier World War II melodrama .
The main departure in plot is altering the action to that of a modern aerial firefighting operation .
The film , however , follows the same basic plot line : the spirit of a recently dead expert pilot mentors a newer pilot , while watching him fall in love with his surviving girlfriend .
The names of the four principal characters of the earlier film are all the same , with the exception of the Ted Randall character , who is called Ted `` Baker '' in the remake and Pete 's last name is `` Sandich '' , instead of `` Sandidge '' .
