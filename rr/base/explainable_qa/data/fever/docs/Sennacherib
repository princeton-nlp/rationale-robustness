Sennacherib -LRB- Akkadian : Sîn-ahhī-erība , `` Sîn has replaced the brothers '' ; -LSB- ܣܝܢܚܪܝܒ , Sīnḥārīḇ -RSB- pronounced in Modern Hebrew -LSB- / sanχeːˈʁiv / -RSB- or in some Mizrahi dialects -LSB- / sanħeːˈʁiv -RSB- -RRB- was the king of Assyria from 705 BCE to 681 BCE .
He is principally remembered for his military campaigns against Babylon and Judah , and for his building programs -- most notably at the Akkadian capital of Nineveh .
He was assassinated in obscure circumstances in 681 BCE , apparently by his eldest son -LRB- his designated successor , Esarhaddon , was the youngest -RRB- .
The primary preoccupation of his reign was the so-called `` Babylonian problem '' , the refusal of the Babylonians to accept Assyrian rule , culminating in his destruction of the city in 689 BCE .
Further campaigns were carried out in Syria -LRB- notable for being recorded in the Bible 's Books of Kings , -RRB- in the mountains east of Assyria , against the kingdoms of Anatolia and against the Arabs in the northern Arabian deserts .
His death was welcomed in Babylon as divine punishment for the destruction of that city .
He was also a notable builder : it was under him that Assyrian art reached its peak .
His building projects included the beautification of Nineveh , a canal 50 km long to bring water to the city , and the `` Palace Without Rival '' , which included what may have been the prototype of the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon , or even the actual Hanging Gardens .
