Judith Quiney -LRB- baptised 2 February 1585 -- 9 February 1662 -RRB- , n√©e Shakespeare , was the younger daughter of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway and the fraternal twin of Shakespeare 's only son Hamnet Shakespeare .
She married Thomas Quiney , a vintner of Stratford-upon-Avon .
The circumstances of the marriage , including Quiney 's misconduct , may have prompted the rewriting of Shakespeare 's will .
Thomas was struck out , while Judith 's inheritance was attached with provisions to safeguard it from her husband .
The bulk of Shakespeare 's estate was left , in an elaborate fee tail , to his elder daughter Susanna and her male heirs .
Judith and Thomas Quiney had three children .
By the time of Judith Quiney 's death , she had outlived her children by many years .
She has been depicted in several works of fiction as part of an attempt to piece together unknown portions of her father 's life .
