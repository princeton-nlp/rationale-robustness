The later 720 , 727 , 737 , and 757 share elements of the 707 's fuselage design .
The 707 was developed from the Boeing 367-80 , a prototype jet first flown in 1954 .
A larger fuselage cross-section and other modifications resulted in the initial-production 707-120 , powered by Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines , which first flew on December 20 , 1957 .
Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26 , 1958 .

The 707-420 , a version of the stretched 707 with Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans , debuted in 1960 , while Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofans debuted on the 707-120B and 707-320B models in 1961 and 1962 , respectively .
The 707 has been used on domestic , transcontinental , and transatlantic flights , and for cargo and military applications .
