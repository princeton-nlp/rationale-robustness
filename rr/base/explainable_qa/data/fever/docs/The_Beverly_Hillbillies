The Beverly Hillbillies is an American sitcom originally broadcast on CBS for nine seasons , from September 26 , 1962 , to March 23 , 1971 .
The show had an ensemble cast featuring Buddy Ebsen , Irene Ryan , Donna Douglas , and Max Baer Jr. as a poor backwoods family who move to Beverly Hills , California , after striking oil on their land .
The show was produced by Filmways and was created by writer Paul Henning .
It was followed by two other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS : Petticoat Junction , and its spin-off Green Acres , which reversed the rags-to-riches , country-to-city model of The Beverly Hillbillies .
The Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top 20 most-watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons , twice ranking as the number one series of the year , with a number of episodes that remain among the most-watched television episodes in history .
It accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run .
The series remains in syndication on MeTV , and its ongoing popularity spawned a 1993 film remake by 20th Century Fox .
