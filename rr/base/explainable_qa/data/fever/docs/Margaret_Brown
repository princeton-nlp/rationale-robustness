Margaret `` Maggie '' Brown -LRB- n√©e Tobin -RRB- -LRB- July 18 , 1867 -- October 26 , 1932 -RRB- -LRB- posthumously known as `` The Unsinkable Molly Brown '' -RRB- was an American socialite and philanthropist .
She is best remembered for exhorting the crew in to return to the debris field of the 1912 sinking of RMS Titanic to look for survivors .
Accounts differ on whether the boat actually returned to look for survivors , and if so , if any survivors were found .
During her lifetime , her friends called her `` Maggie '' , but even by her death , obituaries referred to her as the `` Unsinkable Mrs. Brown '' .
The reference was further reinforced by a 1960 Broadway musical based on her life and its 1964 film adaptation were each entitled The Unsinkable Molly Brown .
