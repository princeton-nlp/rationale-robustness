A seminary , theological seminary , theological college or divinity school is an educational institution for educating students -LRB- sometimes called seminarians -RRB- in theology , generally to prepare them for ordination as clergy , academia , or ministry .
The English word is taken from the Latin seminarium , translated as seed-bed , an image taken from the Council of Trent document Cum adolescentium aetas which called for the first modern seminaries .
In the West , the term now refers to Roman Catholic educational institutes and has widened to include other Christian denominations and American Jewish institutions .
