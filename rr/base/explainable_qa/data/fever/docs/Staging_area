Military
In military usage , a staging area is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed .
The US Department of Defense uses these definitions :
Often and historically this military staging area has been termed a point d'appui , which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument , as in the case of Catto Long Barrow in Aberdeenshire , Scotland .
Unlike normal bases , the facilities of a staging area are temporary , mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime .
Militaries use staging areas to deploy military units , aircraft and warships and materiel ahead of an attack or invasion .
In former times , this used to be generally the border area of one 's own country , but in recent wars -LRB- Gulf War , Kosovo War , Iraq War -RRB- it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access .
Space exploration
Area where final assembly is done on space vehicles before they are moved out to their launch pad .
Data management
Intermediate storage area between the sources of information and the data warehouse -LRB- DW -RRB- or Data mart -LRB- DM -RRB- .
It is usually of temporary nature , and its contents can be erased after the DW/DM has been loaded successfully .
