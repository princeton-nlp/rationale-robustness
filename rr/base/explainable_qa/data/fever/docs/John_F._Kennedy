John Fitzgerald `` Jack '' Kennedy -LRB- May 29 , 1917 -- November 22 , 1963 -RRB- , commonly referred to by his initials JFK , was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963 .
Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War , and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the Soviet Union .
He was a member of the Democratic Party who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate prior to becoming president .
Kennedy was born in Brookline , Massachusetts to Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. and Rose Kennedy .
A scion of the Kennedy family , he graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the United States Naval Reserve the following year .
During World War II , Kennedy commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service .
After the war , Kennedy represented Massachusetts 's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 until 1953 .
He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960 .
While serving in the Senate , he published Profiles in Courage , which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography .
In the 1960 presidential election , Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon , who was the incumbent Vice President .
Kennedy 's time in office was marked by high tensions with Communist states in the Cold War .
He increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam by a factor of 18 over President Dwight D. Eisenhower .
In April 1961 , he authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion .
He subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba .
In October 1962 , U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba ; the resulting period of tensions , termed the Cuban Missile Crisis , nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict .

On November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas .
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the crime , but he was never prosecuted due to his murder by Jack Ruby two days later .
Pursuant to the Presidential Succession Act , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president later that day .
The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin , but various groups believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy .
After Kennedy 's death , many of his proposals were enacted , including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964 .
