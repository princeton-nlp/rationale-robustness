Three Days of the Condor -LRB- stylized on the poster art as 3 Days of the Condor -RRB- is a 1975 American political thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Robert Redford , Faye Dunaway , Cliff Robertson , and Max von Sydow .
The screenplay by Lorenzo Semple Jr. and David Rayfiel was adapted from the 1974 novel Six Days of the Condor by James Grady .
The main point of variance from novel to film lies in the presentation of the CIA .
In Grady 's book , a rogue element within the Agency is motivated by drug-running greed .
In the film , the same individuals act with equal ruthlessness to hide a project intended to protect long-term national interests .
Set mainly in New York City and Washington , D.C. , the film is about a bookish CIA researcher who comes back from lunch , discovers all his co-workers shot dead , and tries to outwit those responsible until he figures out whom he can really trust .
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing .
Semple and Rayfiel received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay .
