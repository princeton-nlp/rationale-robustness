David Mordechai Packouz -LRB- -LSB- pækhaʊs -RSB- born February 16 , 1982 -RRB- is an American former arms dealer , musician , inventor and entrepreneur .
In 2005 , Packouz -LRB- 23 years old at the time -RRB- joined Efraim Diveroli -LRB- 19 years old at the time -RRB- in Diveroli 's arms company AEY Inc. .
By the end of 2006 , the company had won 149 contracts worth around $ 10.5 million .
In early 2007 , AEY secured a nearly $ 300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition , millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles , aviation rockets and other munitions .
The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China , violating the terms of AEY 's contract with the US Army , which bans Chinese ammunition .
Packouz was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted , and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition .
As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .
Packouz was sentenced to seven months house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States .
He is the subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama-comedy film War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Miles Teller .
Packouz has a cameo in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home .
