Barbarella is a 1968 science fiction film directed by Roger Vadim based on the French comic Barbarella .
The film stars Jane Fonda as Barbarella , a representative of the United Earth government in the 41st century sent out to locate the scientist Durand Durand whose positronic ray could end humanity .
Producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to adapt Barbarella into a film .
Vadim took the role as director as he had been a fan of comics and wanted to adapt one to film .
Vadim attempted to cast several actors in the title role , including Virna Lisi , Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren before casting his then wife , Jane Fonda .
Vadim also had his friend Terry Southern write the screenplay ; this was heavily altered during filming and several other writers are credited with it .
The film was particularly popular on its release in the United Kingdom , where it was the second highest grossing film of the year after The Jungle Book .
Contemporary film critics praised the film 's visuals and cinematography , but found the film 's storyline to be weak after the first few scenes .
Since its release , several attempts at sequels , remakes and other adaptations have been planned but none have entered production .
