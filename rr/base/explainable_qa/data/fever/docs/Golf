Golf is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible .
Golf , unlike most ball games , can not and does not utilize a standardized playing area .
The game is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes .
Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from , and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup -LRB- 4.25 inches in width -RRB- .
There are other standard forms of terrain in between , such as the fairway , rough -LRB- long grass -RRB- , sand traps , and hazards -LRB- water , rocks , fescue -RRB- but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement .
Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual , known as stroke play , or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team , known as match play .
Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels .
