My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 American independent adventure drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant , loosely based on Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part 1 , Henry IV , Part 2 , and Henry V , and starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves .
The story follows two friends , Mike and Scott , as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them to Mike 's hometown in Idaho and then to Italy in search of Mike 's mother .
Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s , but discarded it after reading John Rechy 's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy 's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own .
Over the years , Van Sant rewrote the script , which comprised two stories : that of Mike and the search for his mother , and Scott 's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays .
Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing , and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids .
After Van Sant sent copies of his script to Reeves and then Reeves showed it to Phoenix , both agreed to star in the film on each other 's behalf .
My Own Private Idaho had its premiere at the 48th Venice International Film Festival , and received largely positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and those of The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly .
The film was a moderate financial success , grossing over $ 6.4 million in North America , which was above its estimated budget of $ 2.5 million .
Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film , including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival , Best Male Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards , and Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics .
