The Shining is a 1980 British-American psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick , co-written with novelist Diane Johnson , and starring Jack Nicholson , Shelley Duvall , Danny Lloyd , and Scatman Crothers .
The film is based on Stephen King 's 1977 novel The Shining .
Unlike Kubrick 's previous works , which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth , The Shining was released as a mass-market film , initially opening in two U.S. cities on Memorial Day , then nationwide within a month .
The European release of The Shining a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick 's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel .
Although contemporary responses from critics were mixed , assessment became more favorable in following decades , and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made .
American director Martin Scorsese ranked it one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time .
Critics , scholars , and crew members -LRB- such as Kubrick 's producer Jan Harlan -RRB- have discussed the film 's enormous influence on popular culture .
