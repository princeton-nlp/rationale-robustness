The Twilight Zone is an American television anthology series created by Rod Serling .
The episodes are in various genres , including psychological horror , fantasy , science fiction , suspense , and psychological thriller ; and often conclude with a macabre or unexpected twist , and usually with a moral .
A popular and critical success , it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy tropes .
