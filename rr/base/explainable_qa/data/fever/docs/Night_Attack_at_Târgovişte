The Night Attack of Târgovişte -LRB- Atacul de noapte de la Târgovişte , Tirgovişte Baskını -RRB- was a battle fought between forces of Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia and Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on Thursday , June 17 , 1462 .
The conflict initially started with Vlad 's refusal to pay the jizya -LRB- tax on non-Muslims -RRB- to the Sultan and intensified when Vlad Ţepeş invaded Bulgaria and impaled over 23,000 Turks .
Mehmed then raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire .
The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes , the most notable one being the Night Attack where Vlad Ţepeş attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed .
The assassination attempt failed , and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of Târgovişte , where he discovered another some 20,000 impaled Turks .
The Sultan and his troops then sailed to Brăila and burned it to the ground before retreating to Adrianople .
Both sides would claim victory : while Pope Pius II proclaimed Vlad Ţepeş ' campaign a victory for Christianity , Mehmed II 's forces returned home with many captured slaves , horses and cattle .
