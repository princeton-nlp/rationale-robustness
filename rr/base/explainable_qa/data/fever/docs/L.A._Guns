In 1985 , the group was reformed by Guns and singer Paul Black adding Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander .
Black would soon be replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels was added to the group .
Later , Alexander would be replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with this being known as the `` classic lineup '' of L.A. Guns .
They achieved moderate chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
However , the group went through numerous lineup changes -LRB- with Riley being the most consistent member -RRB- and failed to regain mainstream attention .
The `` classic lineup '' of the group would reunite in 1999 and began recording new material .
However , the group continued to change lineups and Guns eventually left to form the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe in 2002 .
L.A. Guns continued without Guns , bringing in guitarist Stacey Blades , however , following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus in 2006 , Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band .
The group 's lineup consisted of former L.A. Guns members Black , Alexander as well as Jeremy Guns -LRB- though the lineup would eventually change -RRB- , with the group eventually changing their name to L.A. Guns .
