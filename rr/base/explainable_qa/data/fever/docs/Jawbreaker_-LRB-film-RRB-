Jawbreaker is a 1999 American black comedy film written and directed by Darren Stein .
The film stars Rose McGowan , Rebecca Gayheart , Julie Benz , and Judy Greer as girls in an exclusive clique in their high school .
Charlotte Ayanna has a non-speaking cameo role as a murdered prom queen .
The film was inspired by the film Heathers , and is often compared to it , particularly the plot involving a popular female clique , and the ostensibly accidental killing of one of its members .
Of his concept for the film , Stein has stated `` The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy sweetness of the girls , of high school and of youth , versus the whole idea that this thing could break your jaw '' .
The film was released on February 19 , 1999 and was a critical and financial failure , although it has come to gain a cult following .
Similarities have been drawn between Jawbreaker and the 2004 film Mean Girls .
