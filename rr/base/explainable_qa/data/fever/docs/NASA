The National Aeronautics and Space Administration -LRB- NASA -LSB- ˈnæsə -RSB- -RRB- is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program , as well as aeronautics and aerospace research .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian -LRB- rather than military -RRB- orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science .
The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29 , 1958 , disestablishing NASA 's predecessor , the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics -LRB- NACA -RRB- .
The new agency became operational on October 1 , 1958 .
Since that time , most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA , including the Apollo Moon landing missions , the Skylab space station , and later the Space Shuttle .
Currently , NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles .
The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program -LRB- LSP -RRB- which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches .
NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System , advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate 's Heliophysics Research Program , exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons , and researching astrophysics topics , such as the Big Bang , through the Great Observatories and associated programs .
NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite .
Since 2011 , NASA has been criticized for low cost efficiency , achieving little results in return for high development costs .
