The cell -LRB- from Latin cella , meaning `` small room '' -RRB- is the basic structural , functional , and biological unit of all known living organisms .
A cell is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently , and cells are often called the `` building blocks of life '' .
The study of cells is called cell biology .
Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane , which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids .
Organisms can be classified as unicellular -LRB- consisting of a single cell ; including bacteria -RRB- or multicellular -LRB- including plants and animals -RRB- .
While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species , humans contain more than 10 trillion -LRB- 1012 -RRB- cells .
Most plant and animal cells are visible only under a microscope , with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres .
The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 , who named the biological unit for its resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery .
Cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells , that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms , that all cells come from preexisting cells , and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells .
Cells emerged on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago .
