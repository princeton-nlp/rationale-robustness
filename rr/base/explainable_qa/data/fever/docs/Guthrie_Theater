The Guthrie Theater , founded in 1963 , is a center for theater performance , production , education , and professional training in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
The concept of the theater was born in 1959 in a series of discussions between Sir Tyrone Guthrie , Oliver Rea and Peter Zeisler .
Disenchanted with Broadway , they intended to form a theater with a resident acting company , to perform classic plays in rotating repertory , while maintaining the highest professional standards .
The Guthrie Theater has performed in two main-stage facilities .
The first building was designed by Ralph Rapson , included a 1,441-seat thrust stage designed by Tanya Moiseiwitsch , and was operated from 1963 -- 2006 .
After closing its 2005 -- 2006 season , the theater moved to its current facility designed by Jean Nouvel .
In 1982 , the theater won the Regional Theatre Tony Award .
