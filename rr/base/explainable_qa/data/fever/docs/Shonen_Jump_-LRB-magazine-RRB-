Shonen Jump , officially stylized SHONEN JUMP and abbreviated SJ , is a shōnen manga anthology published in North America by Viz Media .
It debuted in November 2002 with the first issue having a January 2003 cover date .
Based on Shueisha 's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump , Shonen Jump is retooled for English readers and the American audience , including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one .
It features serialized chapters from four manga series , and articles on Japanese language and culture , as well as manga , anime , video games , and figurines .
Prior to the magazine 's launch , Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous manga anthologies published in North America had failed .
Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the venture , and Cartoon Network , Suncoast , and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine .
In conjunction with the magazine , Viz launched new imprints for releasing media related to the series presented in the magazine , and other shōnen works .
This includes two new manga imprints , an anime DVD imprint , a fiction line for releasing light novels , a label for fan and data books , and a label for the release of art books .
Targeted towards young adult males , the first issue required three printings to meet consumer demand , with over 300,000 copies sold .
It was awarded the ICv2 `` Comic Product of the Year '' award in December 2002 , and has continued to enjoy high sales with a monthly circulation of 215,000 in 2008 .
Approximately half of its circulation comes from subscriptions rather than store sales .
Shonen Jump published its final issue in April 2012 when Viz decided to focus on a weekly digital manga anthology .
