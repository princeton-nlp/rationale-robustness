Jules Henri Poincaré -LRB- -LSB- ʒyl ɑ̃ʁi pwɛ̃kaʁe -RSB- ; 29 April 1854 -- 17 July 1912 -RRB- was a French mathematician , theoretical physicist , engineer , and philosopher of science .
He is often described as a polymath , and in mathematics as The Last Universalist by Eric Temple Bell , since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime .
As a mathematician and physicist , he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics , mathematical physics , and celestial mechanics .
He was responsible for formulating the Poincaré conjecture , which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002 -- 2003 by Grigori Perelman .
In his research on the three-body problem , Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory .
He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology .
Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations , and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form .
Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz -LRB- 1853 -- 1928 -RRB- in 1905 .
Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell 's equations , an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity .
In 1905 , Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves -LRB- ondes gravifiques -RRB- emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations .
The Poincaré group used in physics and mathematics was named after him .
