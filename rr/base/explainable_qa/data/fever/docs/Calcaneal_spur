A calcaneal spur -LRB- or heel spur -RRB- is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity -LRB- heel bone -RRB- .
Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiographic examination -LRB- commonly referred to as an `` x-ray '' -RRB- .
When a foot bone is exposed to constant stress , calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone .
Generally , this has no effect on a person 's daily life .
However , repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other , causing a spur-shaped deformity , called a calcaneal -LRB- or heel -RRB- spur .
Obese people , flatfooted people , and people who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs .
An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period , but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis -LRB- typically in children -RRB- .
A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon .
An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus , which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia .
A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis .
These are also generally visible to the naked eye .
