Following is a 1998 British neo-noir crime drama film written and directed by Christopher Nolan .
It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance .
As Christopher Nolan 's debut feature , it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make .
Scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed to economise on 16mm film stock , the production 's greatest expense ; and for which Nolan was paying from his salary .
Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment , Nolan mostly used available light .
Along with writing , directing , and photographing the film , Nolan also helped in editing and production .
