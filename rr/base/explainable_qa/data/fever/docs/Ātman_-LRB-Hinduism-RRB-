Ātman -LRB- -LSB- ˈɑːtmən -RSB- -RRB- is a Sanskrit word that means inner self or soul .
In Hindu philosophy , especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism , Ātman is the first principle , the true self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena , the essence of an individual .
In order to attain liberation -LRB- moksha -RRB- , a human being must acquire self-knowledge -LRB- atma jnana -RRB- , which is to realize that one 's true self -LRB- Ātman -RRB- is identical with the transcendent self Brahman .
The six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is Ātman -LRB- soul , self -RRB- in every being , a major point of difference with Buddhism , which does not believe that there is either soul or self .
