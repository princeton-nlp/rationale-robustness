Broadchurch series one focused on the search for the boy 's murderer by detectives Alec Hardy -LRB- played by David Tennant -RRB- and Ellie Miller -LRB- played by Olivia Colman -RRB- .
Chibnall was inspired by the Jurassic Coast of Britain to set his crime drama in a fictional , close-knit small town in Dorset .
Much of the tone of the series was inspired by the music of Ã“lafur Arnalds , who also composed the soundtrack for the programme .
Writing on spec , Chibnall persuaded ITV to green-light the series in the autumn of 2011 .
Auditions soon followed , although some actors were offered roles directly .
Principal photography began in August 2012 , with location shooting occurring primarily in towns and villages in Dorset , North Somerset , South Gloucestershire and Bristol .
The production went to great lengths to keep the identity of the murderer secret .
Cast and crew were nominated for many awards for series one ; they won several British Academy Television -LRB- BAFTA -RRB- Awards and a BAFTA Craft Award .
Series two was announced when the first series ended .
The second series primarily focuses on two plot strands : the trial of the murderer and the reopening of the Sandbrook case .
