The Premier League Asia Trophy -LRB- formerly the FA Premier League Asia Cup -RRB- is a pre-season association football friendly tournament held biennial in Asia .
The two-day competition was inaugurated in 2003 and is `` the only Premier League-affiliated competition '' to be hosted outside England .
It has taken place every other summer since then in order to avoid conflicting with the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship .
For sponsorship purposes , it is referred to as the Barclays Asia Trophy .
The competition features three clubs that are members of the Premier League at the time , as well as a local team from the host country .
It employs a knockout system in which the winners of the first matches advance to the final , while the losing teams take part in a third place playoff .
The tournament format will be partly modified for the 2017 edition , with no local team participating after the withdrawal of Shanghai SIPG .
A fourth Premier League club -- Crystal Palace -- agreed to take their place at the last-minute having avoided relegation , marking the first time the tournament has featured teams solely from the Premier League .
Chelsea won the inaugural tournament in 2003 , and finished victorious in another in 2011 .
Five other sides have won the Premier League Asia Trophy : Bolton Wanderers in 2005 , Portsmouth in 2007 , Tottenham Hotspur in 2009 , Manchester City in 2013 , and Arsenal in 2015 .
Chelsea , Tottenham , Man City , Everton , and South China are the most regular participants , having each contested the tournament on two occasions .
Thailand 's under-23 national team are the only local Asian side to advance to the finals of the contest .
Hong Kong has hosted the tournament three times , more than any other city .
