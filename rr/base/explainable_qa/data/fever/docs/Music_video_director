A music video director is the head of music video production .
The director conceives of videos ' artistic and dramatic aspects while instructing the musical act , technical crew , actors , models , and dancers .
They may or may not be in collaboration with the musical act .
On November 8 , 1992 , MTV began listing directors with the artist , song , and record company credits , because music videos had increasingly become an auteur 's medium .
`` The case for the director as music video author is strong .
It is the music video director who has principal control of everything that is added to the pre-existing recorded sound text . ''
Directors , including Michel Gondry , Spike Jonze , and F. Gary Gray , have gone on to direct feature films , continuing a trend that had begun earlier with directors such as Lasse Hallstr√∂m and David Fincher .
The most expensive video of all time was directed by Mark Romanek : Michael and Janet Jackson 's `` Scream '' -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , which cost $ 7 million to produce .
In 2003 , Spike Jonze , Chris Cunningham , and Michel Gondry founded the Directors Label .
