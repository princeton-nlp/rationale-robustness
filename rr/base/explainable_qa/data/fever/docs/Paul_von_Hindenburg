Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg , known generally as Paul von Hindenburg -LRB- -LSB- ˈpaʊl fɔn ˈhɪndn̩bʊɐ̯k -RSB- ; 2 October 1847 -- 2 August 1934 -RRB- was a German military officer , statesman , and politician who largely controlled German policy in the second half of World War I and served as the elected President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934 .
He played the key role in the Nazi `` Seizure of Power '' in January 1933 by appointing Hitler chancellor of a `` Government of National Concentration '' , even though the Nazis were in the minority in cabinet .
Hindenburg retired from the army for the first time in 1911 , but was recalled shortly after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 .
He first came to national attention at the age of 66 as the victor of the decisive Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914 .
As Germany 's Chief of the General Staff from August 1916 , Hindenburg 's reputation rose greatly in German public esteem .
He and his deputy Erich Ludendorff then led Germany in a de facto military dictatorship throughout the remainder of the war , marginalizing German Emperor Wilhelm II as well as the German Reichstag -LRB- Parliament . -RRB-
Hindenburg retired again in 1919 , but returned to public life in 1925 to be elected the second President of Germany .
In 1932 , Hindenburg was persuaded to run for re-election as German president , although 84 years old and in poor health , because he was considered the only candidate who could defeat Adolf Hitler .
Hindenburg was re-elected in a runoff .
He was opposed to Hitler and was a major player in the increasing political instability in the Weimar Republic that ended with Hitler 's rise to power .
He dissolved the Reichstag twice in 1932 and finally , under pressure , agreed to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany in January 1933 .
Hindenburg did this to satisfy Hitler 's demands that he should play a part in the Weimar Government despite losing the election .
In February , he signed off on the Reichstag Fire Decree , which suspended various civil liberties , and in March he signed the Enabling Act of 1933 , which gave Hitler 's regime arbitrary powers .
Hindenburg died the following year , after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and made himself head of state .
