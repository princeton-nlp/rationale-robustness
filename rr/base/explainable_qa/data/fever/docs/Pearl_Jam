One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s , over the course of the band 's career , its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices , including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews , and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster .
In 2006 , Rolling Stone described the band as having `` spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame . ''
To date , the band has sold nearly 32million records in the United States and an estimated 60million worldwide .
Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s , and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade .
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as `` the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s '' .
Pearl Jam were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7 , 2017 , in their first year of eligibility .
