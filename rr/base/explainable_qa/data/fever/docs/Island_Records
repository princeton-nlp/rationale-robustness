Island Records is a British-American record label that operates as a division of Universal Music Group -LRB- UMG -RRB- .
It was founded by Chris Blackwell , Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959 .
Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989 .
Both Island and another label recently acquired by PolyGram , A&M Records , were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history , with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s .
Three Island labels exist in the world : Island UK , Island US , and Island Australia , with the main label operating out of London .
Notable artists on the UK roster include Ariana Grande , U2 , Mumford & Sons , Amy Winehouse , Ben Howard , Florence + The Machine , John Newman , Hozier , Catfish and the Bottlemen , Disclosure , AlunaGeorge , Keane , James Morrison , Annie Lennox , That Poppy and PJ Harvey .
Current key people of Island Records include Island president Darcus Beese , OBE and MD Jon Turner .
Partially due to the label 's significant legacy , Island remains one of UMG 's pre-eminent record labels .
In a 50-year anniversary documentary , Island Records artist Melissa Etheridge stated : `` If you want to look at world music , music of the last fifty years that changed the world , you need look no further than Island Records . ''
