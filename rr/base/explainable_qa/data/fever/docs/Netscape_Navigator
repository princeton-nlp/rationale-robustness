Netscape Navigator is a discontinued proprietary web browser , and the original browser of the Netscape line , from versions 1 to 4.08 , and 9.x .
It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared .
This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation -LRB- later purchased by AOL -RRB- did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .
The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice .
The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .
The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997 .
Netscape Communicator 's 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite , which was later renamed SeaMonkey .
Netscape 's Mozilla Suite also served as the base for a browser-only spinoff called Mozilla Firefox .
The Netscape Navigator name returned in 2007 when AOL announced version 9 of the Netscape series of browsers , Netscape Navigator 9 .
On 28 December 2007 , AOL canceled its development but continued supporting the web browser with security updates until 1 March 2008 .
AOL allows downloading of archived versions of the Netscape Navigator web browser family .
AOL maintains the Netscape website as an Internet portal .
