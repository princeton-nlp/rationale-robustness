Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System , after Jupiter .
It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth .
Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth , with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive .
Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture ; its astronomical symbol represents the god 's sickle .
Saturn 's interior is probably composed of a core of iron -- nickel and rock -LRB- silicon and oxygen compounds -RRB- .
This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium , and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer .
Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere .
Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn 's planetary magnetic field , which is weaker than Earth 's , but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn 's larger size .
Saturn 's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter 's .
The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast , although long-lived features can appear .
Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1800 km/h , higher than on Jupiter , but not as high as those on Neptune .
Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust .
Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn , of which fifty-three are officially named .
This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings .
Titan , Saturn 's largest moon , and the second-largest in the Solar System , is larger than the planet Mercury , although less massive , and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere .
