A mixtape -LRB- also mix-tape or mix tape -RRB- is a home-made compilation of music -LRB- typically copyrighted songs taken from other sources -RRB- recorded in a specific order , traditionally onto a cassette tape , though later replaced by CD or MP3 playlist formats .
The songs can be sequential , or by beatmatching the songs and creating overlaps and fades between the end of one song and the beginning of another the tape may become a seamless whole .
Compilations may include a selection of favorite songs , or music linked by theme or mood , perhaps tailored to the tape 's intended recipient .
Writing in 2004 , essayist Geoffrey O'Brien called the personal mix tape `` perhaps the most widely practiced American art form '' .
`` Mixtape '' is also used in hip hop to describe certain types of recordings , typically self-produced and independently released albums that are issued free of charge to gain publicity and/or circumvent possible copyright infringement .
