Hourglass is singer-songwriter James Taylor 's fourteenth studio album .
Taylor 's first studio album in six years was released in 1997 to glowing notices .
It built upon the success of his previous effort , New Moon Shine .
Hourglass was an introspective album that earned Taylor his best critical reviews in almost twenty years .
The album 's lyrics focused largely on Taylor 's troubled past and family .
`` Jump Up Behind Me '' paid tribute to his father 's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days , and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill .
`` Enough to Be On Your Way '' was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade .
The themes were also inspired by Taylor 's divorce from actress Kathryn Walker , which took place in 1996 .
Rolling Stone found that `` one of the themes of this record is disbelief '' , while Taylor told the magazine that it was `` spirituals for agnostics . ''
Critics embraced the dark themes on the album , and Hourglass was a huge commercial success , reaching # 9 on the Billboard 200 -LRB- Taylor 's first Top 10 album in sixteen years -RRB- and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on `` Little More Time With You '' .
The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT , when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998 .
There is an Enhanced CD version of the album containing interviews , photos , and videos .
