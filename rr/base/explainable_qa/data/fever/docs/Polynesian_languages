The Polynesian languages are a language family spoken in geographical Polynesia and on a patchwork of outliers from south central Micronesia to small islands off the northeast of the larger islands of the southeast Solomon Islands and sprinkled through Vanuatu .
They are classified as part of the Austronesian family , belonging to the Oceanic branch of that family .
Polynesians share many unique cultural traits that resulted from about 1000 years of common development , including common linguistic development , in the Tonga and Sāmoa area through most of the first millennium BC .
There are approximately forty Polynesian languages .
The most prominent of these are Tahitian , Sāmoan , Tongan , Māori and Hawaiian .
Because the Polynesian islands were settled relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago , their languages retain strong commonalities .
There are still many cognate words across the different islands e.g. tapu , ariki , motu , kava -LRB- Kava culture -RRB- , and tapa as well as Hawaiki , the mythical homeland for some of the cultures .
All Polynesian languages show strong similarity , particularly in vocabulary .
The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages , nearly always a , e , i , o and u .
The legendary homeland of the Māori of New Zealand , where w is used instead of v , is called Hawaiki ; in the Cook Islands , where h is replaced with the glottal stop , it is ` Avaiki ; in the Hawaiian Islands , where w is used and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island of the group is named Hawai`i ; in Sāmoa , where s has not been replaced by h , v is used instead of w , and k is replaced with the glottal stop , the largest island is called Savai'i .
In the Society Islands , k and ng are replaced by the glottal stop , so the name for the ancestral homeland is pronounced Havai`i .
