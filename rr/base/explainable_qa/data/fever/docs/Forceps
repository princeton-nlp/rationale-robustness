Forceps -LRB- plural forceps or forcipes -RRB- are a handheld , hinged instrument used for grasping and holding objects .
Forceps are used when fingers are too large to grasp small objects or when many objects need to be held at one time while the hands are used to perform a task .
The term ` forceps ' is used almost exclusively within the medical field .
Outside medicine , people usually refer to forceps as tweezers , tongs , pliers , clips or clamps .
In English ` forceps ' can be used as both the singular and plural form of the word -LRB- example : `` I need a forceps '' -RRB- ; in Latin it is a singular .
Also , it is not referred to as a `` pair '' as one refers to a `` pair of scissors '' .
Mechanically , forceps employ the principle of the lever to grasp and apply pressure .
Surgical forceps are commonly made of high-grade carbon steel , which ensures they can withstand repeated sterilization in high-temperature autoclaves .
Lower quality steel is used in forceps made for other uses .
Some forceps , intended to be used once and then discarded , are made of plastic .
The invention of surgical forceps is attributed to Stephen Hales .
There are two basic types of forceps : non-locking -LRB- often called ` thumb forceps ' or ` pick-ups ' -RRB- and locking , though these two types come in dozens of specialized forms for various uses .
Non-locking forceps also come in two basic forms : hinged at one end , away from the grasping end -LRB- colloquially such forceps are called tweezers -RRB- and hinged in the middle , rather like scissors .
Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle , though some forms place the hinge very close to the grasping end .
Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp , grasp or hold an object .
