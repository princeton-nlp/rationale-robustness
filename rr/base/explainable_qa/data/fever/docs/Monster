A monster is any creature , usually found in legends or horror fiction , that is often hideous and may produce fear or physical harm by its appearance or its actions .
The word `` monster '' derives from Latin monstrum , meaning an aberrant occurrence , usually biological , that was taken as a sign that something was wrong within the natural order .
The word usually connotes something wrong or evil ; a monster is generally morally objectionable , physically or psychologically hideous , or a freak of nature .
It can also be applied figuratively to a person with similar characteristics like a greedy person or a person who does horrible things .
The root of monstrum is monere -- which does not only mean to warn but also to instruct , and forms the basis of the modern English demonstrate .
Thus , the monster is also a sign or instruction .
This benign interpretation was proposed by Saint Augustine , who did not see the monster as inherently evil , but as part of the natural design of the world , a kind-of deliberate category error .
Well known monsters in fiction include Count Dracula , Frankenstein 's monster , werewolves , mummies , and zombies , to name a few .
