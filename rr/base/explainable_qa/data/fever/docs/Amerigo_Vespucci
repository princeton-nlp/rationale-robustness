Amerigo Vespucci -LRB- -LSB- ameˈriːɡo vesˈputtʃi -RSB- ; March 9 , 1454February 22 , 1512 -RRB- was an Italian explorer , financier , navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia 's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus ' voyages , but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Old Worlders .
Colloquially referred to as the New World , this second super continent came to be termed `` Americas '' , deriving its name from Americus , the Latin version of Vespucci 's first name .
