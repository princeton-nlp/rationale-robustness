`` Here Comes the Sun '' is a song written by George Harrison that was first released on the Beatles ' 1969 album Abbey Road .
Along with `` Something '' and `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' , it is one of Harrison 's best-known compositions from the Beatles era .
The song was written at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton , where Harrison had chosen to play truant for the day , to avoid attending a meeting at the Beatles ' Apple Corps organisation .
The lyrics reflect the composer 's relief at both the arrival of spring and the temporary respite he was experiencing from the band 's business affairs .
The Beatles recorded `` Here Comes the Sun '' at London 's EMI Studios in the summer of 1969 .
Led by Harrison 's acoustic guitar , the recording also features Moog synthesizer , which he had introduced to the Beatles ' sound after acquiring an early model of the instrument in California .
Reflecting the continued influence of Indian classical music on Harrison 's writing , the composition includes a series of unusual time changes .
`` Here Comes the Sun '' has received acclaim from music critics .
Combined with his other contribution to Abbey Road , `` Something '' , it gained for Harrison the level of recognition as a songwriter that had previously been reserved for his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney .
Harrison played the song during many of his relatively rare live performances as a solo artist , including at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 and , with Paul Simon , during his appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1976 .
Richie Havens and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel each had hit singles with `` Here Comes the Sun '' in the 1970s .
Nina Simone , George Benson , Booker T. & the M.G. 's , Peter Tosh and Joe Brown are among the many other artists who have covered the song .
