Capsicum chinense , commonly known as the `` bonnet pepper '' is a species of chili pepper native to the Americas .
C. chinense varieties are well known for their exceptional heat and unique flavors .
The hottest peppers in the world are members of this species , with Scoville Heat Unit scores of over 1.5 million .
Some taxonomists consider them to be part of the species C. annuum , and they are a member of the C. annuum complex .
C. annuum and C. chinense pepper plants can generally be identified by the number of flowers or fruit per node , however -- one for C. annuum and two to five for C. chinense , though this method is not always correct .
The two species can also hybridize and generate inter-specific hybrids .
It is believed that C. frutescens is the ancestor to the C. chinense species .
