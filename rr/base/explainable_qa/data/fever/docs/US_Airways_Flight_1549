US Airways Flight 1549 was an Airbus A320-214 which , three minutes after takeoff from New York City 's LaGuardia Airport on January 15 , 2009 , struck a flock of Canada geese just northeast of the George Washington Bridge and consequently lost all engine power .
Unable to reach any airport , pilots Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles glided the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River off midtown Manhattan .
All 155 people aboard were rescued by nearby boats and there were few serious injuries .
The incident came to be known as the `` Miracle on the Hudson '' ,
and a National Transportation Safety Board official described it as `` the most successful ditching in aviation history . ''
The Board also rejected the notion that the ditching could have been avoided had the crew immediately returned to LaGuardia or diverted to nearby Teterboro airport .
The pilots and flight attendants were awarded the Master 's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in recognition of their `` heroic and unique aviation achievement '' .
