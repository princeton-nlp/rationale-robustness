The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained , often ghastly occurrences , which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe .
The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials , influenced by film and television shows such as Lost , The X-Files , Altered States , and The Twilight Zone .
The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons .
Most episodes contain a standalone plot , with several others also exploring the series ' overarching mythology .
Critical reception was at first lukewarm but became more favorable after the first season , when the series began to explore its mythology , including parallel universes and alternate timelines .
The show , as well as the cast and crew , were nominated for many major awards .
Despite its move to the `` Friday night death slot '' and low ratings , the series developed a cult following .
It also spawned two six-part comic book series , an alternate reality game , and three novels .
