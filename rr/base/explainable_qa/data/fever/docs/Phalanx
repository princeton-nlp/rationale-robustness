The phalanx -LRB- φάλαγξ plural phalanxes or phalanges , φάλαγγες , phalanges -RRB- was a rectangular mass military formation , usually composed entirely of heavy infantry armed -RSB- s , pikes , sarissas , or similar weapons .
The term is particularly -LRB- and originally -RRB- used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare , although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation , regardless of its equipment , as does Arrian in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions .
In Greek texts , the phalanx may be deployed for battle , on the march , even camped , thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle .
They marched forward as one entity .
The word phalanx is derived from the Greek word phalangos , meaning finger .
The term itself , as used today , does not refer to a distinctive military unit or division -LRB- e.g. , the Roman legion or the contemporary Western-type battalion -RRB- , but to the general formation of an army 's troops .
Thus a phalanx does not have a standard combat strength or composition but includes the total number of infantry , which is or will be deployed in action in a single phalanx formation .
Many spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be termed phalanx-like formations .
The word has come into use in common English to describe `` a group of people standing , or moving forward closely together '' ; c.f. `` a phalanx of police '' .
This article focuses on the use of the military phalanx formation in Ancient Greece , the Hellenistic world , and other ancient states heavily influenced by Greek civilization .
