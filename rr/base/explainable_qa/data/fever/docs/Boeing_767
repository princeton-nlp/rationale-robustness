The Boeing 767 is a mid - to large-size , long-range , wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes .
It was Boeing 's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit .
The aircraft has two turbofan engines , a conventional tail , and , for reduced aerodynamic drag , a supercritical wing design .
Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747 , the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people , and a design range of 3850 to , depending on variant .
Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet , the 757 , resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft .
The 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths .
The original 767-200 entered service in 1982 , followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER , an extended-range -LRB- ER -RRB- variant , in 2000 .
The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988 , respectively , while a production freighter version , the 767-300F , debuted in 1995 .
Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use , while military derivatives include the E-767 surveillance aircraft , the KC-767 and KC-46 aerial tankers , and VIP transports .
Engines featured on the 767 include the General Electric CF6 , Pratt & Whitney JT9D and PW4000 , and Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans .
United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982 .
The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes , during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design .
In 1985 , the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights .
The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium - to long-haul intercontinental routes .
In 1986 , Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767 , ultimately leading to the development of the 777 , a larger wide-body twinjet .
In the 1990s , the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe .
The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered .
As of April 2017 , Boeing has received 1,204 orders for the 767 from 74 customers ; 1,098 have been delivered .
A total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in July 2016 ; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER , with 583 delivered ; Delta Air Lines is the largest operator , with 91 aircraft .
Competitors have included the Airbus A300 , A310 , and A330-200 , while a successor , the 787 Dreamliner , entered service in October 2011 .
Despite this , the 767 still remains in production .
