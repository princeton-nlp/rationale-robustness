A mole is a massive structure , usually of stone , used as a pier , breakwater , or a causeway between places separated by water .
The word comes from Middle French mole , ultimately from Latin mōlēs , meaning a large mass , especially of rock , and it has the same root as molecule .
A mole may have a wooden structure built on top of it that resembles a wooden pier .
The defining feature of a mole , however , is that water can not freely flow underneath it , unlike a true pier .
The oldest known mole is at Wadi al-Jarf , an ancient Egyptian harbor complex on the Red Sea .
