Stagira -LRB- -LSB- stəˈdʒaɪrə -RSB- -RRB- , Stagirus -LRB- -LSB- stəˈdʒaɪrəs -RSB- -RRB- , or Stageira -LRB- Στάγειρα or Στάγειρος -RRB- was an ancient Greek city , located in central Macedonia , near the eastern coast of the peninsula of Chalkidice , and is chiefly known for being the birthplace of Aristotle , who was a Greek philosopher and polymath , a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great .
The city lies approximately 8 km north northeast of the present-day village of Stagira , close to the town of Olympiada .
Stagira was founded in 655 BC by Ionian settlers from Andros .
Xerxes I of Persia occupied it in 480 BC .
The city later joined the Delian League , led by Athens , but left in 424 BC : as a result , the Athenian demagogue Cleon laid siege to it in 422 BC .
However , Cleon was a poor strategist and his conduct of the siege was very inefficient : so much so that the ancient Greek comedy writer Aristophanes satirised him in the play The Knights .
Cleon died in the same year , in the battle of Amphipolis .
Later , during the Peloponnesian War , Stagira sided with Sparta against the Athenians .
In 348 BC , Philip II of Macedon occupied and destroyed the city .
In return for Aristotle 's tutoring of his son Alexander , Philip later rebuilt the city and resettled the old city 's inhabitants , who had been enslaved .
Many new structures were built at this time , including an aqueduct , two shrines to Demeter , and many houses .
