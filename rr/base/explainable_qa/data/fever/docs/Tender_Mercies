Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film directed by Bruce Beresford .
The screenplay by Horton Foote focuses on Mac Sledge , a recovering alcoholic country music singer who seeks to turn his life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural Texas .
Robert Duvall plays the role of Mac ; the supporting cast includes Tess Harper , Betty Buckley , Wilford Brimley , Ellen Barkin and Allan Hubbard .
Financed by EMI Films , Tender Mercies was shot largely in Waxahachie , Texas .
The script was rejected by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it .
Duvall , who sang his own songs in the film , drove more than 600 mi throughout the state , tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands to prepare for the role .
He and Beresford repeatedly clashed during production , at one point prompting the director to walk off the set and reportedly consider quitting the film .
The film encompasses several different themes , including the importance of love and family , the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death , and the concept of redemption through Mac Sledge 's conversion to Christianity .
Following poor test screening results , distributor Universal Pictures made little effort to publicize Tender Mercies , which Duvall attributed to the studio 's lack of understanding of country music .
The film was released on March 4 , 1983 , in a limited number of theaters .
Although unsuccessful at the box office , it was critically acclaimed and earned five Academy Award nominations , including one for Best Picture .
Tender Mercies won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for Foote and Best Actor for Duvall .
