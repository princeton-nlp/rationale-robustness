A monk -LRB- -LSB- mʌŋk -RSB- , from μοναχός , monachos , `` single , solitary '' and Latin monachus -RRB- is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living , either alone or with any number of other monks .
A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings , or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation .
The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy .
In the Greek language the term can apply to women , but in modern English it is mainly in use for men .
The word nun is typically used for female monastics .
Although the term monachos is of Christian origin , in the English language `` monk '' tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds .
However , being generic , it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk , such as cenobite , hermit , anchorite , hesychast , or solitary .
