A central venous catheter -LRB- CVC -RRB- , also known as a central line , central venous line , or central venous access catheter , is a catheter placed into a large vein .
Catheters can be placed in veins in the neck -LRB- internal jugular vein -RRB- , chest -LRB- subclavian vein or axillary vein -RRB- , groin -LRB- femoral vein -RRB- , or through veins in the arms -LRB- also known as a PICC line , or peripherally inserted central catheters -RRB- .
It is used to administer medication or fluids that are unable to be taken by mouth or would harm a smaller peripheral vein , obtain blood tests -LRB- specifically the `` central venous oxygen saturation '' -RRB- , and measure central venous pressure .
