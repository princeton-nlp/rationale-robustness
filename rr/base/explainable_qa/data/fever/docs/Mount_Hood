Mount Hood , called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe , is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc of northern Oregon .
It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States .
It is located about 50 mi east-southeast of Portland , on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties .
In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence .
The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history .
Modern sources point to three different heights : 11249 ft , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey -LRB- NGS -RRB- , 11240 ft based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11239 ft of slightly older origin .
The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields .
It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range .
Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt ,
though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely .
Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent , so the U.S. Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- characterizes it as `` potentially active '' , but the mountain is informally considered dormant .
