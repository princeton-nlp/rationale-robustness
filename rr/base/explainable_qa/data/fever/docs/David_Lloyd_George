David Lloyd George , 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor , -LRB- 17 January 1863 -- 26 March 1945 -RRB- was a British Liberal politician and statesman of Welsh parentage and upbringing .
As Chancellor of the Exchequer -LRB- 1908 -- 1915 -RRB- , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state .
His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government -LRB- 1916 -- 22 -RRB- , during and immediately after the First World War .
He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers .
Historian Martin Pugh in The Oxford Companion to British History argues that :
He made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system -LRB- especially medical insurance , unemployment insurance , and old-age pensions , largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land -RRB- .
Furthermore , in foreign affairs he played a leading role in winning the First World War , redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference , and partitioning Ireland .
As Prime Minister , Lloyd George favoured the Conservatives in his coalition in the 1918 elections , leaving the Liberal Party a minority .
He became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , but it grew even smaller and more divided .
By the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure .
He gave weak support to the Second World War amidst fears that he was favourable toward Germany .
He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .
