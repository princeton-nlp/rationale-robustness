The Tenth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor , the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who , who is played by David Tennant in three series as well as nine specials .
As with previous incarnations of the Doctor , the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs .
In the programme 's narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time in his TARDIS , frequently with companions .
When the Doctor is critically injured beyond medical repair , he can regenerate his body ; in doing so , his physical appearance and personality change , and a new actor assumes the role .
Tennant 's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked .
This incarnation 's companions include working class shop assistant Rose Tyler -LRB- Billie Piper -RRB- , medical student Martha Jones -LRB- Freema Agyeman -RRB- , and fiery temp worker Donna Noble -LRB- Catherine Tate -RRB- .
He eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale , `` Journey 's End '' , after which he attempts to travel alone for the duration of the 2008 -- 2010 specials before being accompanied by Donna Noble 's grandfather Wilfred Mott on his final adventure in The End of Time .
In November 2013 , Tennant 's Doctor was voted `` The UK 's favourite Doctor '' in a survey held by the Radio Times magazine .
