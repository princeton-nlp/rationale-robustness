So You Think You Can Dance is an American televised dance competition show that airs on Fox in the United States and is the flagship series of the international So You Think You Can Dance television franchise .
It was created by American Idol producers Simon Fuller and Nigel Lythgoe and is produced by 19 Entertainment , Dick Clark Productions and Conrad Sewell Productions .
The series premiered on July 20 , 2005 with over ten million viewers and ended the summer season as the top-rated show on television .
The first season was hosted by American news personality Lauren SÃ¡nchez .
Since the second season , it has been hosted by former British children 's television personality and game show emcee Cat Deeley .
During its second season , the program remained the No. 1 rated summer show -LRB- adults aged 18 -- 49 -RRB- , but it has declined in ratings since .
The show features a tiered format wherein dancers trained in a variety of dance genres enter open auditions held in a number of major U.S. cities to showcase their talents and may move forward through successive additional rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles .
At the end of this process , a small number of dancers are chosen as finalists .
These dancers move on to the competition 's main phase , where they perform solo , duet , and group dance numbers on live television .
They compete for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which , combined with the input of a panel of judges , determines which dancers advance to the next stage from week to week .
The number of finalists has varied as determined by a season 's format , but has often been 20 contestants .
Competitors attempt to master various dance styles , including classical , contemporary , ballroom , hip-hop , street , club , jazz , and musical theatre styles , among others .
These are usually assigned by a luck-of-the-draw system during the successive weeks of elimination .
The eventual champion wins a cash prize -LRB- typically $ 250,000 -RRB- and the title `` America 's Favorite Dancer '' .
In thirteen seasons , the winners have been Nick Lazzarini , Benjamin `` Benji '' Schwimmer , Sabra Johnson , Joshua Allen , Jeanine Mason , Russell Ferguson , Lauren Froderman , Melanie Moore , Eliana Girard , Chehon Wespi-Tschopp , Amy Yakima , Du-Shaunt `` Fik-Shun '' Stegall , Ricky Ubeda , Gaby Diaz and Leon `` Kida '' Burns .
Girard and Wespi-Tschopp shared the title as dual-winners for the ninth season , and Yakima and Stegall as the winners of the tenth .
Since season 7 , finalists have been paired with a So You Think You Can Dance `` All-Star '' as a partner and sometimes a mentor .
The show has won seven Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography and a total of nine Emmy Awards altogether .
Licensed variations of the show , produced for broadcast markets in other nations , began airing in August 2005 , and to date 25 localized adaptations of So You Think You Can Dance have been produced in as many countries .
On January 30 , 2017 , Fox renewed the series for a fourteenth season , which returns to its former contestant age range of 18-30 but keeps the All-Star partnerships .
