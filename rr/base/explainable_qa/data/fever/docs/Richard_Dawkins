Clinton Richard Dawkins -LRB- born 26 March 1941 -RRB- is an English ethologist , evolutionary biologist and author .
He is an emeritus fellow of New College , Oxford , and was the University of Oxford 's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008 .
Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene , which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme .
With his book The Extended Phenotype -LRB- 1982 -RRB- , he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism 's body , but can stretch far into the environment .
In 2006 , he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .
Dawkins is an atheist , and is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design .
In The Blind Watchmaker -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , he argues against the watchmaker analogy , an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms .
Instead , he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction , mutation , and selection are unguided by any designer .
In The God Delusion -LRB- 2006 -RRB- , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion .
He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools .
Dawkins has been awarded many prestigious academic and writing awards and he makes regular television , radio and Internet appearances , predominantly discussing his books , his atheism , and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual .
