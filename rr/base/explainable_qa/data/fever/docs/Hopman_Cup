The Hopman Cup is an annual international eight-team indoor hardcourt tennis tournament held in Perth , Western Australia in early January -LRB- sometimes commencing in late December -RRB- each year , which plays mixed-gender teams on a country-by-country basis .
The championship is named in honour of Harry Hopman -LRB- 1906 -- 1985 -RRB- , an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 Davis Cup titles between 1938 and 1969 .
Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989 , it has been attended each year by Harry Hopman 's widow , his second wife Lucy , who travels to the tournament annually from her home in the United States .
The tournament is a sanctioned event in the calendar of the International Tennis Federation -LRB- ITF -RRB- , but while individual player results are tallied , they are not included in the calculation of tennis world rankings .
The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the Australian Open Series .
The winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and up to 2014 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball encrusted with diamonds from the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia .
In 2014 and 2015 , the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball , using just under an ounce of 18-carat white , yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds .
These trophies are valued at $ 26,000 .
Until 2012 , the Hopman Cup was played at the Burswood Dome .
Since 2013 , the Hopman Cup has been played at the Perth Arena .
