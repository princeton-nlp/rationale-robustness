Girl with a Pearl Earring is a 2003 drama film directed by Peter Webber .
The screenplay was adapted by screenwriter Olivia Hetreed , based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier .
Scarlett Johansson stars as Griet , a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer -LRB- played by Colin Firth -RRB- at the time he painted Girl with a Pearl Earring -LRB- 1665 -RRB- in the city of Delft in Holland .
Other cast members include Tom Wilkinson , Cillian Murphy , and Judy Parfitt .
Hetreed read the novel before its publication , and her husband 's production company convinced Chevalier to sell the film rights .
Initially , the production was to feature Kate Hudson as Griet with Mike Newell directing .
Hudson withdrew shortly before filming began , however , and the film was placed in hiatus until the hire of Webber , who re-initiated the casting process .
In this , which was his feature film debut , Webber sought to avoid employing traditional characteristics of the period film drama .
Cinematographer Eduardo Serra used distinctive lighting and colour schemes similar to Vermeer 's paintings .
