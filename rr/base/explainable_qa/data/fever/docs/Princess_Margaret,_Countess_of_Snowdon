Princess Margaret , Countess of Snowdon , -LRB- Margaret Rose ; 21 August 1930 -- 9 February 2002 -RRB- was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom and the only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II .
Margaret spent much of her childhood in the company of her older sister and parents .
Her life changed dramatically in 1936 , when her paternal uncle , King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry a divorc√©e , Wallis Simpson .
Margaret 's father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive , with Margaret second in line to the throne .
During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada .
During the war years , Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties and instead continued her education .
After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend .
In 1952 , Margaret 's father died , her sister became Queen , and Townsend divorced his first wife .
Early the following year , he proposed to Margaret .
Many in the government believed he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen 's 22-year-old sister , and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man .
Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him and in 1960 , she accepted the proposal of the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones , who was created Earl of Snowdon by the Queen .
The couple had two children .
They divorced in 1978 .
Margaret was often viewed as a controversial member of the British royal family .
Her divorce earned her negative publicity , and she was romantically associated with several men .
Her health gradually deteriorated in the final two decades of her life .
A heavy smoker for most of her adult life , she had a lung operation in 1985 , a bout of pneumonia in 1993 , and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001 .
She died at King Edward VII Hospital on 9 February 2002 .
