Epistemology -LRB- -LSB- ɪ-ˌpɪstɪ-ˈmɒlədʒi -RSB- -RRB- is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge .
Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge , justification , and the rationality of belief .
Much of the debate in epistemology centers on four areas : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth , belief , and justification , -LRB- 2 -RRB- various problems of skepticism , -LRB- 3 -RRB- the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- the criteria for knowledge and justification .
The term ` Epistemology ' was first used by Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854 .
However , according to Brett Warren , King James VI of Scotland had previously personified this philosophical concept as the character Epistemon in 1591 .
