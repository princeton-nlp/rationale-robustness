Born in Bonn , then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire , Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and by composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe .
At the age of 21 he moved to Vienna , where he began studying composition with Joseph Haydn and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist .
He lived in Vienna until his death .
By his late 20s his hearing began to deteriorate , and by the last decade of his life he was almost completely deaf .
In 1811 he gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose ; many of his most admired works come from these last 15 years of his life .
