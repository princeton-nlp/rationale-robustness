Dysphonia , one common form of which is referred to as hoarse voice , refers to dysfunction in the ability to produce voice .
For voice to be classified as `` dysphonic '' , abnormalities must be present in one or more vocal parameters : pitch , loudness , quality , or variability .
Perceptually , dysphonia can be characterised by hoarse , breathy , harsh , or rough vocal qualities , but some kind of phonation remains .
Current prevalence rates suggest that dysphonia is higher in females and the elderly , however , it can be found in both sexes and across the lifespan .
Furthermore , certain occupational groups , such as teachers and singers , may be at increased risk for developing dysphonia .
Dysphonia can be categorized into two broad main types : organic and functional .
The type of dysphonia is dependent on the cause of the pathology .
While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories , all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation , which affects the voice .
The assessment and diagnosis of dysphonia is done by a multidisciplinary team , and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures , which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx.Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of dysphonia .
Dysphonia can be targeted through direct therapy , indirect therapy , medical treatments , and surgery .
Functional dysphonias may be treated through direct and indirect voice therapies , whereas surgeries are recommended for chronic , organic dysphonias .
