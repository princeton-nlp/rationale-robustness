The Youth Olympic Games -LRB- YOG -RRB- is an international multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee .
The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format .
The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck , Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012 .
The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18 .
The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998 .
On 6 July 2007 , International Olympic Committee -LRB- IOC -RRB- members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved the creation of a youth version of the Olympic Games , with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city , whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC .
These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes .
Several other Olympic events for youth , like the European Youth Olympic Festival held every other year with summer and winter versions , and the Australian Youth Olympic Festival , have proven successful .
The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events .
The YOG are also a successor to the discontinued World Youth Games .
The Summer Youth Olympic Games of Singapore in 2010 and Nanjing in 2014 each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days , whereas the Winter YOG of Innsbruck in 2012 had 1059 athletes and Lillehammer in 2016 had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days .
Even though this exceeded initial estimates , the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents .
The next Summer YOG to take place will be the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games of Buenos Aires .
The next Winter YOG to take place will be the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games of Lausanne .
