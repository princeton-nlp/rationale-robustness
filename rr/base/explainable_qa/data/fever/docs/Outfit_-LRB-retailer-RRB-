Outfit is a UK company which forms part of the Arcadia Group and began life in the 1990s .
It sells a range of clothing , footwear and accessories for both men and women .
The company began life in the 1990s when Sears plc saw a gap in the market .
The 1990s saw a big growth in out of town retail parks which seemed to be the new alternative to town centre shopping .
Sears saw this as an opportunity to house all their fashion brands under one roof .
The first Outfit store opened in 1995 at Riverside Retail Park in Nottingham .
The Nottingham store proved such a success that more stores soon opened .
In 1999 Outfit became part of Arcadia Group Ltd and is continually growing .
