The Enough Project conducts research in several conflict areas in Africa including Sudan , South Sudan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the Central African Republic , and the areas controlled by the Lord 's Resistance Army -LRB- LRA -RRB- .
The Enough Project facilitates several campaigns and initiatives which work to bring attention to these crises , including The Sentry , Raise Hope for Congo , and the Satellite Sentinel Project .
Its co-founders are John Prendergast and Gayle Smith .
In 2014 , the Enough Project released a report on war lordism and the mines of the Congo .
The report indicated that due to the economic pressure of a provision of the United States Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act , which required any company that might be using `` conflict minerals '' to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and publish their supply chain , control over the mines had passed out of the hands of the warlords and local militias .
