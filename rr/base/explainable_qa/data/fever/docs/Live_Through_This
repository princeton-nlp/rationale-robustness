Live Through This is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Hole .
It was released by DGC Records on April 12 , 1994 , just one week after frontwoman Courtney Love 's husband , Kurt Cobain , died in their home .
It was Hole 's only album to feature bassist Kristen Pfaff before her death in June 1994 .
Recorded in October 1993 , the album marked a divergence from the band 's unpolished hardcore aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure , and features production by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie , with mixing by Scott Litt and J Mascis .
The album 's lyrics and packaging reflect Love 's preoccupation with beauty , and its songs contain repeated motifs of milk , motherhood , anti-elitism , and violence against women .
The album 's title is derived from a quote in Gone with the Wind .
The album met near-unanimous critical acclaim upon release , earning top-100 chart spots in seven countries and going multi-platinum .
It has been considered as a contemporary classic , and was included in Rolling Stones list of `` 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' .
The album is featured on the list 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .
The album was also named the 84th greatest album of all time in a list produced by NME magazine in 2013 .
As of 2010 , it has sold over 1.6 million copies in the United States .
