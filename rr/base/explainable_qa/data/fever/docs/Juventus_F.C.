The uninterrupted relationship between the club and the Torinese industrial dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports , making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country .
Juventus established itself as a major force at national level since the 1930s and at confederation level since mid-1970s .
Since then , under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni , who led the Torinese team to thirteen official trophies in ten years until 1986 , including six league titles and five international titles ; Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations : the European Champions ' Cup , the -LRB- now-defunct -RRB- Cup Winners ' Cup and the UEFA Cup -LRB- the first Italian and Southern European side to win the tournament -RRB- .
With its successive triumphs in the Super Cup in 1984 and in the Intercontinental Cup in 1985 , the club become also the first in the world -- and remains the only one at present -- to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies , an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1999 .
In 2000 , Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA 's century ranking of the best clubs in the world -- the highest for an Italian club -- , while nine years later , according to the all-time ranking published by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics , an organisation recognised by FIFA , based on clubs ' performance in international competitions , Juventus were Italy 's best club and second in Europe of the 20th century .
The club 's fan base is the largest at national level and is one of the largest worldwide .
Unlike most European sporting supporters groups -- often concentrated around their own club 's city of origin -- , it is widespread throughout the Apennine Peninsula and abroad , mainly in countries with a significant presence of Italian immigrants , making Juventus a symbol of campanilismo -LRB- `` Anti-parochialism '' -RRB- and italianità -LRB- `` Italianness '' -RRB- along with the club 's tradition of success , some of which have had a significant impact in Italian society , especially in the 1930s and the first post-war decade , as well as the ideological politics and socio-economic origin of the club 's sympathisers and the club 's contribution to the national team -- the most for an Italian club -- , uninterrupted since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential in international football , having performed a decisive role in the Azzurri 's World Cup triumphs of 1934 , 1982 and 2006 .
