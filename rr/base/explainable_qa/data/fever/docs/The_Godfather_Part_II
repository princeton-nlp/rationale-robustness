The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo , starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro .
Partially based on Puzo 's 1969 novel The Godfather , the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather , presenting parallel dramas : one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone -LRB- Pacino -RRB- , the new Don of the Corleone crime family , protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life ; the prequel covers the journey of his father , Vito Corleone -LRB- De Niro -RRB- , from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City .
The Godfather Part II opened to mixed reviews from critics , many of whom praised its cinematography while finding its nonlinear narrative disorganized .
It was nominated for eleven Academy Awards , however , and became the first sequel to win for Best Picture .
Its six Oscar wins included Best Director for Coppola , Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo .
Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor .
Both The Godfather Part II and its predecessor remain highly influential films in the gangster genre , and the former has been reevaluated .
In 1997 , the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later .
Some have deemed it superior to the 1972 original .
It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993 , being deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .
The Godfather Part III , a later sequel , was released in 1990 .
