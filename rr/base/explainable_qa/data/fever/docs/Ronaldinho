`` Ronaldinho '' , the lengthened term of endearment for `` Ronaldo '' , is accompanied in Brazilian usage by the nickname `` Gaúcho '' -LRB- since he hails from southern Brazil -RRB- , in order to distinguish him from fellow footballer and countryman Ronaldo , who was known as `` Ronaldinho '' in Brazil beforehand .
