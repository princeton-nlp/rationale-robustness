This was Sandler 's second film to eclipse $ 120 million worldwide in 1998 along with The Wedding Singer .
Adam Sandler 's character , Bobby Boucher -LRB- pronounced -LSB- buː ' ʃeɪ -RSB- -RRB- , bears a strong resemblance to his `` The Excited Southerner '' comedic skits from his album What the Hell Happened to Me ?
The portrayal is one of a stereotypical Cajun from the bayous of South Louisiana , not the typical stereotype of a Southerner .
He also shares similarities in speech and mannerism to Canteen Boy , a recurring character , also portrayed by Sandler , on Saturday Night Live .
Like Bobby , Canteen Boy was a soft-spoken manchild who preferred `` purified water , right out of the old canteen , '' which he always carried with him .
