The Faroe Islands , also called the Faeroes , is an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic , about halfway between Norway and Iceland , 200 mi north-northwest of Scotland .
The Islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark .
Its area is about 1,400 km2 with a population of 50,030 in April 2017 .
The land of the Faeroes is rugged , and these islands have a subpolar oceanic climate -LRB- Cfc -RRB- : windy , wet , cloudy , and cool .
Despite this island group 's northerly latitude , temperatures average above freezing throughout the year because of the Gulf Stream .
Between 1035 and 1814 , the Faeroes were part of the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway .
In 1814 , the Treaty of Kiel granted Denmark control over the islands , along with two other Norwegian island possessions : Greenland and Iceland .
The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948 .
The Faroese have control of most domestic matters .
Areas that remain the responsibility of Denmark include military defence , the police department , the justice department , currency , and foreign affairs .
However , as they are not part of the same customs area as Denmark , the Faroe Islands have an independent trade policy , and can establish trade agreements with other states .
The islands also have representation in the Nordic Council as members of the Danish delegation .
The people of the Faroe Islands also compete as a national team in certain sports .
