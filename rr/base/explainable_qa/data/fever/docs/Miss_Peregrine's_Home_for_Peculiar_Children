Miss Peregrine 's Home for Peculiar Children is a dark fantasy debut novel by American author Ransom Riggs .
It is a story of a boy who , following a horrific family tragedy , follows clues that take him to an abandoned children 's home on a Welsh island .
The story is told through a combination of narrative and vernacular photographs from the personal archives of collectors listed by the author .
This young adult book was originally intended to be a picture book featuring photographs Riggs had collected , but on the advice of an editor at Quirk Books , he used the photographs as a guide from which to put together a narrative .
Riggs was a collector of photographs , but needed more for his novel .
He met Leonard Lightfoot , a well-known collector at the Rose Bowl Flea Market , and was introduced to other collectors .
The result was a story about a boy who follows clues from his grandfather 's old photographs which lead him on an adventure that takes him to a large abandoned orphanage on Cairnholm , a Welsh island .
The book has been a New York Times best seller .
It reached the # 1 spot on the Children 's Chapter Books list on April 29 , 2012 , after being on the list for 45 weeks , remaining there until 20 May , when it dropped to the fourth spot on the list .
Critics have generally praised the book for creative use of vintage photographs as well as good characterisation and settings .
