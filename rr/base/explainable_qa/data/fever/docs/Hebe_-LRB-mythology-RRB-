Hebe -LRB- -LSB- ˈhiːbi -RSB- Ἥβη -RRB- in ancient Greek religion , is the goddess of youth -LRB- Roman equivalent : Juventas -RRB- .
She is the daughter of Zeus and Hera .
Hebe was the cupbearer for the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus , serving their nectar and ambrosia , until she was married to Heracles -LRB- Roman equivalent : Hercules -RRB- ; her successor was the divine hero Ganymede .
Another title of hers , for this reason , is Ganymeda .
She also drew baths for her brother Ares and helped Hera enter her chariot .
Hebe was supposed to have the power to give eternal youth , and in art is typically seen with her father in the guise of an eagle , often offering a cup to him .
This depiction is seen in classical engraved gems as well as later art and seems to relate to a belief that the eagle -LRB- like the phoenix -RRB- had the ability to renew itself to a youthful state .
