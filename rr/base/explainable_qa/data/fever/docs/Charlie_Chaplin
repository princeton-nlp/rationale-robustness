Sir Charles Spencer `` Charlie '' Chaplin , -LRB- 16 April 1889 -- 25 December 1977 -RRB- was an English comic actor , filmmaker , and composer who rose to fame during the era of silent film .
Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona `` the Tramp '' and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry .
His career spanned more than 75 years , from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977 , and encompassed both adulation and controversy .
Chaplin 's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship .
As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially , he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine .
When he was 14 , his mother was committed to a mental asylum .
Chaplin began performing at an early age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian .
At 19 , he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America .
Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios .
He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base .
Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations .
By 1918 , he was one of the best-known figures in the world .
In 1919 , Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists , which gave him complete control over his films .
His first feature-length was The Kid -LRB- 1921 -RRB- , followed by A Woman of Paris -LRB- 1923 -RRB- , The Gold Rush -LRB- 1925 -RRB- , and The Circus -LRB- 1928 -RRB- .
He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s , instead producing City Lights -LRB- 1931 -RRB- and Modern Times -LRB- 1936 -RRB- without dialogue .
Chaplin became increasingly political , and his next film , The Great Dictator -LRB- 1940 -RRB- , satirised Adolf Hitler .
The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin , and his popularity declined rapidly .
He was accused of communist sympathies , while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal .
An FBI investigation was opened , and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland .
He abandoned the Tramp in his later films , which include Monsieur Verdoux -LRB- 1947 -RRB- , Limelight -LRB- 1952 -RRB- , A King in New York -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , and A Countess from Hong Kong -LRB- 1967 -RRB- .
Chaplin wrote , directed , produced , edited , starred in , and composed the music for most of his films .
He was a perfectionist , and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture .
His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , typified in the Tramp 's struggles against adversity .
Many contain social and political themes , as well as autobiographical elements .
In 1972 , as part of a renewed appreciation for his work , Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for `` the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century '' .
He continues to be held in high regard , with The Gold Rush , City Lights , Modern Times , and The Great Dictator often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time .
