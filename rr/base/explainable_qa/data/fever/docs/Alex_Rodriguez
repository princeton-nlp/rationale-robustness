Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez -LRB- born July 27 , 1975 -RRB- , nicknamed `` A-Rod '' , is a Dominican-American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman .
He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- for the Seattle Mariners , Texas Rangers , and New York Yankees .
Rodriguez was one of the sport 's most highly touted prospects and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time .
During his 22-year career , Rodriguez has amassed a .297 batting average , 696 home runs , over 2,000 runs batted in -LRB- RBI -RRB- , over 2,000 runs scored , and over 3,000 hits .
He is a 14-time All-Star and has won three American League -LRB- AL -RRB- Most Valuable Player -LRB- MVP -RRB- Awards , ten Silver Slugger Awards , and two Gold Glove Awards .
Rodr√≠guez is the career record holder for grand slams with 25 .
However , he has led a highly controversial career due to signing two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history while incurring criticism from the media for his behavior and use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs .
The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft , and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18 .
In 1996 , he became the Mariners ' starting shortstop and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award .
Rodriguez 's combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers .
The 10-year , $ 252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history .
He played at a high level in his three years with Texas , highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003 , but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure .
Prior to the 2004 season , Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees , for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop Derek Jeter .
In his first four seasons with New York , he was twice more named AL MVP .
After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season , Rodriguez signed a new 10-year , $ 275 million deal with the Yankees , extending his record for the sport 's most lucrative contract .
He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs , reaching the milestone in 2007 .
He won his first World Series in 2009 , which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium .
The following year , he became the career leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent .
In recent years , Rodriguez has been hampered by hip and knee injuries , which have caused him to exclusively become a designated hitter .
He played his final game as a Yankee on August 12 , 2016 .
In February 2009 , after previously denying use of performance-enhancing drugs , including during a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes , Rodriguez admitted to using steroids , saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for Rangers due to `` an enormous amount of pressure '' to perform .
While recovering from a hip injury in 2013 , Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal .
In August 2013 , MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the scandal , but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment .
Had the original suspension been upheld , it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history .
After an arbitration hearing , the suspension was reduced to 162 games , keeping him off the field for the entire 2014 season .
