Inception is a 2010 science fiction film written , co-produced , and directed by Christopher Nolan , and co-produced by Emma Thomas .
The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious , and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for a seemingly impossible task : `` inception '' , the implantation of another person 's idea into a target 's subconscious .
The ensemble cast additionally includes Ken Watanabe , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Marion Cotillard , Ellen Page , Tom Hardy , Dileep Rao , Cillian Murphy , Tom Berenger , and Michael Caine .
After the 2002 completion of Insomnia , Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment about a horror film envisioning `` dream stealers '' based on lucid dreaming .
Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity , Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005 's Batman Begins , 2006 's The Prestige , and The Dark Knight in 2008 .
The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009 .
Inception was filmed in six countries , beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22 .
