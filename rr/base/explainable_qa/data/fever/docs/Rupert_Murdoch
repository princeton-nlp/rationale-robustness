His father , Sir Keith Murdoch , had been a reporter , editor , and senior executive of the Herald and Weekly Times newspaper publishing company , covering all Australian states except New South Wales .
After his father 's death in 1952 , Murdoch declined to join his late father 's registered public company and created his own private company , News Limited .

In the 1950s and 1960s , Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand , before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969 , taking over the News of the World , followed closely by The Sun .
Murdoch moved to New York City in 1974 , to expand into the U.S. market ; however , he retained interests in Australia and Britain .
In 1981 , Murdoch bought The Times , his first British broadsheet , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen -LRB- and as a result , gave up Australian citizenship -RRB- in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership .
In 1986 , keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies , Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in Wapping , causing bitter industrial disputes .
Murdoch 's News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , HarperCollins -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , and The Wall Street Journal -LRB- 2007 -RRB- .

By 2000 , Murdoch 's News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries , with a net worth of over $ 5 billion .
In July 2011 , Murdoch faced allegations that his companies , including the News of the World , owned by News Corporation , had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities , royalty , and public citizens .
Murdoch faces police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the U.S. On 21 July 2012 , Murdoch resigned as a director of News International .
On 1 July 2015 , Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox .
