Handheld camera , shaky cam , queasy cam , queasicam , hand-held camera or free camera is a cinematographic technique where stable-image techniques are purposely dispensed with .
The camera is held in the hand , or given the appearance of being hand-held , and in many cases shots are limited to what one photographer could have accomplished with one camera .
Shaky cam is often employed to give a film sequence an ad hoc , electronic news-gathering , or documentary film feel .
It suggests unprepared , unrehearsed filming of reality , and can provide a sense of dynamics , immersion , instability or nervousness .
The technique can be used to give a pseudo-documentary or cinéma vérité appearance to a film .
Too much shaky camera motion can make some viewers feel distracted , dizzy or sick .
