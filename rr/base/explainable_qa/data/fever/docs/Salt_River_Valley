The Salt River Valley is an extensive valley on the Salt River in central Arizona , which contains the Phoenix Metropolitan Area .
Although this geographic term still identifies the area , the name `` Valley of the Sun '' popularly replaced the usage starting in the early 1930s for purposes of boosterism .
A common dust for testing air filter efficiency was derived from top soil dust from the Salt River Valley , referred to as Arizona Dust .
The dust was found to include small abrasive particles .
