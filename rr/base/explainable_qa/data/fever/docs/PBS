The Public Broadcasting Service -LRB- PBS -RRB- is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor .

PBS is funded by member station dues , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , government agencies , corporations , foundations and individual citizens .
All proposed funding is subjected to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source .
Since the mid-2000s , Roper polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the United States .
However , PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations , a large proportion of which -LRB- including most specials aired during pledge drives -RRB- come from affiliates , including such member stations as WGBH , WETA-TV , WNET , WTTW National Productions -RRB- , American Public Television and independent producers .
This arbitrary distinction is a frequent source of viewer confusion .

It also operates National Datacast -LRB- NDI -RRB- , a subsidiary which offers datacasting services via member stations , and provides additional revenue for PBS and its member stations .
