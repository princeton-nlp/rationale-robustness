Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg -LRB- -LSB- ˈʃɛlbɜːrɡ -RSB- , -LSB- ˈfeːlɪks ² ɕɛlːˌbærj -RSB- ; born on 24 October 1989 -RRB- , better known by his online pseudonym PewDiePie -LRB- -LSB- ˈpjuːdipaɪ -RSB- -RRB- , is a Swedish web-based comedian and video producer .
He is known for his Let 's Play commentaries and vlogs on YouTube .
Born in Gothenburg , Sweden , PewDiePie originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology .
In 2010 , during his time at the university , he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie .
The following year , he dropped out of Chalmers after growing bored with his degree field , much to the dismay of his parents .
After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia , he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel .
In order to fund his videos , PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand .
PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following , and in July 2012 , his channel surpassed one million subscribers .
Early on , PewDiePie was signed under the multi-channel network Machinima .
After dissatisfaction with the network , he signed with Maker Studios , having his channel under Maker 's sub-networks Polaris , and later , Revelmode .
Throughout his time on YouTube , PewDiePie has produced content that has been praised as genuine and unfiltered , but also been received as abrasive , and in some cases , met with controversy .
As a result of an early 2017 controversy regarding allegations of anti-Semitism in several of PewDiePie 's videos , the Disney-operated Maker Studios ended their partnership with him , dropping him from their network .
While he criticised the coverage of the situation and defended his content as jokes that were taken out of context , he conceded its offensiveness .
Since 15 August 2013 , PewDiePie has been the most-subscribed user on YouTube , being surpassed briefly in November and December 2013 by YouTube 's Spotlight channel .
Holding the position since 22 December 2013 , the channel has over 55 million subscribers as of May 2017 .
From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017 , PewDiePie 's channel held the distinction of being the most viewed of all time , and as of May 2017 , the channel has received over 15 billion video views .
PewDiePie refers to his fanbase as the `` Bro Army '' , and individual fans as `` bros '' .
Through his Bro Army fanbase , PewDiePie has raised money for charities .
Due to his popularity , PewDiePie 's coverage of indie games has created an Oprah effect , boosting sales for titles he plays .
In 2016 , Time named him one of `` The World 's 100 Most Influential People '' .
PewDiePie lives in Brighton with his girlfriend , Italian YouTube personality Marzia Bisognin .
