Corsica -LRB- -LSB- ˈkɔrsɪkə -RSB- Corse -LSB- kɔʁs -RSB- Corsican and Italian : Corsica -LSB- ˈkɔrsika -RSB- -RRB- is an island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 13 regions of France .
It is located west of the Italian Peninsula , southeast of the French mainland , and north of the Italian island of Sardinia .
A single chain of mountains makes up two-thirds of the island .
While being part of France , Corsica is also designated as a territorial collectivity -LRB- collectivité territoriale -RRB- by law .
As a territorial collectivity , Corsica enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than other French regions ; for example , the Corsican Assembly is able to exercise limited executive powers .
The island formed a single department until it was split in 1975 into two departments : Haute-Corse -LRB- Upper Corsica -RRB- and Corse-du-Sud -LRB- Southern Corsica -RRB- , with its regional capital in Ajaccio , the prefecture city of Corse-du-Sud .
Bastia , the prefecture city of Haute-Corse , is the second-largest settlement in Corsica .
After being ruled by the Republic of Genoa since 1284 , Corsica was briefly an independent Corsican Republic from 1755 until it was conquered by France in 1769 .
Due to Corsica 's historical ties with the Italian peninsula , the island retains to this day many elements of the culture of Italy .
The native Corsican language , whose northern variant is closely related to the Italian language , is recognised as a regional language by the French government .
This Mediterranean island was ruled by various nations over the course of history but had several brief periods of independence .
Napoleon was born in 1769 in the Corsican capital of Ajaccio .
His ancestral home , Maison Bonaparte , is today used as a museum .
