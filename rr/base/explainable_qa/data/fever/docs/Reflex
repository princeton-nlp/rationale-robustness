A reflex , or reflex action , is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus .
A reflex is made possible by neural pathways called reflex arcs which can act on an impulse before that impulse reaches the brain .
The reflex is then an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought .
