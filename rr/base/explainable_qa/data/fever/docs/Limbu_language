Limbu is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Nepal , India Darjeeling , Kalimpong , Sikkim , Assam , and Nagaland -RRB- , Bhutan , Burma , Thailand , the United Kingdom , Hong Kong , Canada , and the USA .
It is falsely believed that the Limbu/Yakthung are multi-lingual , but there are hundred and/or thousand of Yakthung who speak only in Yakthungpan -LRB- Limbu language -RRB- .
The Limbu refer to themselves as Yakthung and their language as Yakthungpan .
Yakthungpan has four main dialects : Phedape , Chhathare , Tambarkhole , and Panthare dialects .
Among four dialects and/or many dialects , Phedape dialect is widely spoken and well understood by most Yakthungpan speakers .
However , as there are some dominant Panthare scholars who have role to create knowledge and control knowledge in the Limbu communities , Panthare dialect is being popularized as a `` standard '' Limbu language .
As Panthare Yakthungs are much more engaged in central political position and administrative positions , they are trying to introduce Panthare dialect as a Standard Yakthungpan .
Yakthungpan -LRB- Limbu language -RRB- is one of the major languages spoken and written in Nepal , Darjeeling , Kalimpong , Sikkim , Bhutan , Burma , and Thailand .
Today , linguists have reached the conclusion that Yakthungpan resembles Tibetan and Lepcha .
Before the introduction of the Sirijanga script among Limbu Kirats , the Rong script was popular in East Nepal , especially in the early Maurong state .
The Sirijanga script had almost disappeared for 800 years and it was brought back into use by Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe of Tellok Sinam Limbuwan present day Nepal .
