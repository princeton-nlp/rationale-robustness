Mutiny on the Bounty is a 1962 American Technicolor epic historical drama film starring Marlon Brando , Trevor Howard and Richard Harris , based on the novel Mutiny on the Bounty by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall .
The film retells the 1789 real-life mutiny aboard HMAV Bounty led by Fletcher Christian against the ship 's captain , William Bligh .
It is the second American film to be made from the novel , the first being Mutiny on the Bounty -LRB- 1935 -RRB- .
It was directed by Lewis Milestone , who replaced Carol Reed early in the production schedule , and it turned out to be Milestone 's final film .
The screenplay was written by Charles Lederer -LRB- with uncredited input from Eric Ambler , William L. Driscoll , Borden Chase , John Gay and Ben Hecht -RRB- .
The score was composed by Bronis≈Çaw Kaper .
Mutiny on the Bounty was filmed in the Ultra Panavision 70 widescreen process , the first motion picture so credited .
It was partly shot on location in the South Pacific .
Behind the scenes , Marlon Brando effectively took over directing duties himself and caused it to become far behind schedule and over budget -- resulting in director Carol Reed pulling out of the project and being replaced by Lewis Milestone who is credited as director of the picture .
The film was heavily panned , and was considered a box office bomb , having lost over $ 6 million .
A replica of the Bounty was constructed for the film .
Fifty years after the release of the film , the vessel sank in Hurricane Sandy with loss of life .
