Bret Easton Ellis -LRB- born March 7 , 1964 -RRB- is an American author , screenwriter , and short story writer .
His works have been translated into 27 languages .
He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack , which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney .
He is a self-proclaimed satirist , whose trademark technique , as a writer , is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style .
Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common , recurring characters .
Though Ellis made his debut at age 21 with the controversial bestseller Less Than Zero -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles , the work he is most known for is his third novel , American Psycho -LRB- 1991 -RRB- .
On its release , the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic .
Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster , the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year .
In later years , Ellis ' novels have become increasingly metafictional .
Lunar Park -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , a pseudo-memoir and ghost story , received positive reviews .
Imperial Bedrooms -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero , continues in this vein .
Four of Ellis 's works have been made into films .
Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen , leading to the release of a starkly different film of the same name in 1987 .
Mary Harron 's adaptation of American Psycho was released to generally positive reviews in 2000 and went on to achieve cult status .
Roger Avary 's 2002 adaptation The Rules of Attraction made modest box office returns but went on to attract a cult following .
2008 's The Informers , based on Ellis 's collection of short stories , was critically panned .
Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the critically derided 2013 film The Canyons , an original work .
