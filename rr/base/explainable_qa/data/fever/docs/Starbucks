Starbucks is considered the main representative of `` second wave coffee '' , initially distinguishing itself from other coffee-serving venues in the US by taste , quality , and customer experience while popularizing darkly roasted coffee .
Since the 2000s , third wave coffee makers have targeted quality-minded coffee drinkers with hand-made coffee based on lighter roasts , while Starbucks nowadays uses automated espresso machines for efficiency and safety reasons .
Starbucks locations serve hot and cold drinks , whole-bean coffee , microground instant coffee known as VIA , espresso , caffe latte , full - and loose-leaf teas including Teavana tea products , Evolution Fresh juices , Frappuccino beverages , La Boulange pastries , and snacks including items such as chips and crackers ; some offerings -LRB- including their annual fall launch of the Pumpkin Spice Latte -RRB- are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store .
Many stores sell pre-packaged food items , hot and cold sandwiches , and drinkware including mugs and tumblers ; select `` Starbucks Evenings '' locations offer beer , wine , and appetizers .
Starbucks-brand coffee , ice cream , and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at grocery stores .
Starbucks first became profitable in Seattle in the early 1980s .
Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the Midwest and British Columbia in the late 1980s , the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into California in the early 1990s .
