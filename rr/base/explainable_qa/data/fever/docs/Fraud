In law , fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain , or to deprive a victim of a legal right .
Fraud itself can be a civil wrong -LRB- i.e. , a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation -RRB- , a criminal wrong -LRB- i.e. , a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities -RRB- or it may cause no loss of money , property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong .
The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits , such as obtaining a driver 's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements .
A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim .
