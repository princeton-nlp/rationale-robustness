Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming , created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 .
An interpreted language , Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability -LRB- notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords -RRB- , and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java .
The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale .
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms , including object-oriented , imperative , functional programming , and procedural styles .
It has a large and comprehensive standard library .
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems , allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems .
CPython , the reference implementation of Python , is open source software and has a community-based development model , as do nearly all of its variant implementations .
CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation .
