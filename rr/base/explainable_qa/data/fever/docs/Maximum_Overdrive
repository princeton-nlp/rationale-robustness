Maximum Overdrive is a 1986 American science fiction action horror comedy film written and directed by Stephen King .
The film stars Emilio Estevez , Pat Hingle , Laura Harrington , and Yeardley Smith .
The screenplay was inspired by and loosely based on King 's short story `` Trucks '' , which was included in King 's first collection of short stories , Night Shift .
Maximum Overdrive is King 's only directorial effort , though dozens of films have been based on one of his novels or short stories .
The film contained black humor elements and a generally campy tone , which contrasts with King 's sombre subject matter in books .
The film has a mid-1980s hard rock soundtrack composed entirely by the group AC/DC , King 's favorite band .
AC/DC 's album Who Made Who was released as the Maximum Overdrive soundtrack .
It includes the best-selling singles `` Who Made Who '' , `` You Shook Me All Night Long '' , and `` Hells Bells '' .
The film was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Director for King and Worst Actor for Estevez in 1987 , but both lost against Prince for Under the Cherry Moon .
In 1988 , Maximum Overdrive was nominated for `` Best Film '' at the International Fantasy Film Awards .
King himself described the film as a `` moron movie '' and stated his intention to never direct again soon after .
King considers the film a learning experience .
