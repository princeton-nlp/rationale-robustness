A player-coach -LRB- also playing coach , captain-coach , or player-manager -RRB- is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and coaching duties .
A player-coach may be a head coach or an assistant coach .
They may make changes to the squad and also play on the team .
Very few current major professional sports teams have head coaches who are also players , though it is extremely common for senior players to take a role in managing more junior athletes .
Historically , when professional sports had much less money to pay players and coaches or managers , it was much more common to find them .
Likewise , where player-coaches exist today , they are more common at the lower levels where money is less available , but not exclusively .
