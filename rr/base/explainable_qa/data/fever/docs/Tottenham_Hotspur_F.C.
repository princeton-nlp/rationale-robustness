Tottenham Hotspur Football Club -LSB- ˈtɒtnəm , _ - tənəm -RSB- , commonly referred to as Spurs , is an English football club located in Tottenham , Haringey , London , that competes in the Premier League .
The club 's home for the 2017-18 season will be Wembley Stadium , as their former home of White Hart Lane is being dismantled to make way for a completely new rebuilt stadium on the same site .
Their newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield .
Founded in 1882 , Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901 , making them the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888 .
Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double , winning both competitions in the 1960 -- 61 season .
After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962 , in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition -- the European Cup Winners ' Cup .
In 1967 , Spurs won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s .
In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and were the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972 , becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies .
In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies : the FA Cup twice , FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984 .
In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup .
When they won the League Cup once more in 2008 , it meant that they had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades -- an achievement only matched by Manchester United .
