Jean-Michel Basquiat -LRB- -LSB- ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl baskija -RSB- ; December 22 , 1960 -- August 12 , 1988 -RRB- was an American artist .
Born in Brooklyn to a Haitian father and Puerto Rican mother , Basquiat first achieved fame as part of SAMO © , an informal graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s where the hip hop , post-punk , and street art movements had coalesced .
By the 1980s , he was exhibiting his neo-expressionist paintings in galleries and museums internationally .
The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992 .
Basquiat 's art focused on `` suggestive dichotomies '' , such as wealth versus poverty , integration versus segregation , and inner versus outer experience .
He appropriated poetry , drawing , and painting , and married text and image , abstraction , figuration , and historical information mixed with contemporary critique .
Basquiat used social commentary in his paintings as a `` springboard to deeper truths about the individual '' , as well as attacks on power structures and systems of racism , while his poetics were acutely political and direct in their criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle .
He died of a heroin overdose at his art studio at age 27 .
On May 18 , 2017 , at a Sotheby 's auction , Basquiat 's 1982 painting , also Untitled , created with oil stick and spray paint and depicting a skull , set a new record high for any U.S. artist at auction , selling for $ 110,500,000 .
