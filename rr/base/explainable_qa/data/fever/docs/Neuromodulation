Neuromodulation is the physiological process by which a given neuron uses one or more chemicals to regulate diverse populations of neurons .
This is in contrast to classical synaptic transmission , in which one presynaptic neuron directly influences a single postsynaptic partner .
Neuromodulators secreted by a small group of neurons diffuse through large areas of the nervous system , affecting multiple neurons .
Major neuromodulators in the central nervous system include dopamine , serotonin , acetylcholine , histamine , and norepinephrine .
Neuromodulation can be conceptualized as a neurotransmitter that is not reabsorbed by the pre-synaptic neuron or broken down into a metabolite .
Such neuromodulators end up spending a significant amount of time in the cerebrospinal fluid -LRB- CSF -RRB- , influencing -LRB- or `` modulating '' -RRB- the activity of several other neurons in the brain .
For this reason , some neurotransmitters are also considered to be neuromodulators , such as serotonin and acetylcholine .
Neuromodulation is often contrasted with classical fast synaptic transmission .
In both cases the transmitter acts on local postsynaptic receptors , but in neuromodulation , the receptors are typically G-protein coupled receptors while in classical chemical neurotransmission , they are ligand-gated ion channels .
Neurotransmission that involves metabotropic receptors -LRB- like G-protein linked receptors -RRB- often also involves voltage-gated ion channels , and is relatively slow .
Conversely , neurotransmission that involves exclusively ligand-gated ion channels is much faster .
A related distinction is also sometimes drawn between modulator and driver synaptic inputs to a neuron , but here the emphasis is on modulating ongoing neuronal spiking versus causing that spiking .
