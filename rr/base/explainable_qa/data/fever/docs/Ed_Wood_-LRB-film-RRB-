Ed Wood is a 1994 American biographical period comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton , and starring Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker Ed Wood .
The film concerns the period in Wood 's life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi , played by Martin Landau .
Sarah Jessica Parker , Patricia Arquette , Jeffrey Jones , Lisa Marie , and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast .
The film was conceived by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts .
Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel , Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic , and Michael Lehmann as director .
Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads , Lehmann had to vacate the director 's position , which was taken over by Burton .
Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures , but the studio put the film in `` turnaround '' over Burton 's decision to shoot in black-and-white .
Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios , which produced the film through the studio 's Touchstone Pictures division .
The film was released to critical acclaim , but was a box office bomb , making only $ 5.9 million against an $ 18 million budget .
It won two Academy Awards : Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker -LRB- who designed Landau 's prosthetic makeup -RRB- , Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng .
