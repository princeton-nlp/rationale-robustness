Paris , also known as Alexander -LRB- Ἀλέξανδρος , Aléxandros -RRB- , the son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy , appears in a number of Greek legends .
Probably the best-known was his elopement with Helen , queen of Sparta , this being one of the immediate causes of the Trojan War .
Later in the war , he fatally wounds Achilles in the heel with an arrow as foretold by Achilles 's mother Thetis .
The name Paris is probably Luwian and comparable to Pari-zitis attested as a Hittite scribe 's name .
