Injustice 2 introduces a new feature called the Gear System , a loot-dropping system that rewards players with costume pieces and equipment that can be used to customize characters ' appearances and modify their abilities and stats .
According to developers , the idea for implementing an RPG-style progression system into a fighting game had existed since before the fall of Midway Games , the original publisher for the Mortal Kombat series .
Director Ed Boon also sought to incorporate gameplay mechanics used by multiplayer shooter games , such as personalization , character creation , loot , and leveling up , into the fighting game genre , which led to the development of the Gear System .

The game received positive reviews from critics , who praised its story , presentation , improved gameplay mechanics , abundance of in-game content , and character customization options , while criticizing its random loot and microtransaction systems .
