Chinatown is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery film , directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne , starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway .
The film was inspired by the California Water Wars , a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century , by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights in the Owens Valley .
The Robert Evans production , a Paramount Pictures release , was the director 's last film in the United States and features many elements of film noir , particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama .
In 1991 , the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being `` culturally , historically or aesthetically significant '' and it is frequently listed as one of the greatest films of all-time .
At the 47th Academy Awards , it was nominated for eleven Oscars , with Towne winning Best Original Screenplay .
The Golden Globe Awards honored it for Best Drama , Best Director , Best Actor and Best Screenplay .
The American Film Institute placed it second among mystery films in 2008 .
A sequel , The Two Jakes , was released in 1990 , again starring Nicholson , who also directed , with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay .
The film failed to generate the acclaim of its predecessor .
