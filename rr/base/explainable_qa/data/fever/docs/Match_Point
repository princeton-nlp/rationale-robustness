Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish psychological thriller film written and directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Scarlett Johansson , Emily Mortimer , Matthew Goode , Brian Cox , and Penelope Wilton .
In the film , Rhys Meyers 's character marries into a wealthy family , but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law 's girlfriend , played by Johansson .
The film treats themes of morality , greed , and the roles of lust , money , and luck in life , leading many to compare it to Allen 's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors -LRB- 1989 -RRB- .
It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York .
The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom .
Allen quickly re-wrote the script , which was originally set in New York , for a British setting .
Critics in the United States praised the film and its British setting , and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen .
In contrast , reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably , finding fault with the locations and especially the idiom of the dialogue .
Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay .
