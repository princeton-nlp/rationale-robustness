The Cordilleran ice sheet was a major ice sheet that periodically covered large parts of North America during glacial periods over the last ~ 2.6 million years .
This included the following areas :
Western Montana
The Idaho Panhandle
Northern Washington state down to about Olympia and Spokane
All of British Columbia
The southwestern third or so of Yukon Territory
All of the Alaska Panhandle
South Central Alaska
The Alaska Peninsula
Almost all of the continental shelf north of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
The ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the Last Glacial Maximum and probably more than that in some previous periods , when it may have extended into the northeast extremity of Oregon and the Salmon River Mountains in Idaho .
It is probable , though , that its northern margin also migrated south due to the influence of starvation caused by very low levels of precipitation .
At its eastern end the Cordilleran ice sheet merged with the Laurentide ice sheet at the Continental Divide , forming an area of ice that contained one and a half times as much water as the Antarctic ice sheet does today .
At its western end it is believed nowadays that several small glacial refugia existed during the last glacial maximum below present sea level in the now-submerged Hecate Strait and on the Brooks Peninsula in northern Vancouver Island .
However , evidence of ice-free refugia above present sea level north of the Olympic Peninsula has been refuted by genetic and geological studies since the middle 1990s .
The ice sheet faded north of the Alaska Range because the climate was too dry to form glaciers .
Unlike the Laurentide ice sheet , which is believed to have taken as much as eleven thousand years to fully melt , it is believed the Cordilleran ice sheet , except for areas that remain glaciated today , melted very quickly , probably in four thousand years or less .
This rapid melting caused such floods as the overflow of Lake Missoula and shaped the topography of the extremely fertile Inland Empire of Eastern Washington .
