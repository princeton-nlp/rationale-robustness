Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge , and rejected faith and religion .
She supported rational and ethical egoism , and rejected altruism .
In politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral , and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism , and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights .
In art , Rand promoted romantic realism .
She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , and classical liberals .
Literary critics received Rand 's fiction with mixed reviews , and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy , though academic interest has increased in recent decades .
The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , both to the public and in academic settings .
She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives .
