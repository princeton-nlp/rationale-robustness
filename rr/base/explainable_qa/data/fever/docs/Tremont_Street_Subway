The Tremont Street Subway in Boston 's MBTA Subway system is the oldest subway tunnel in North America and the third oldest worldwide to exclusively use electric traction -LRB- after the City and South London Railway in 1890 , and the Budapest Metro 's Line 1 in 1896 -RRB- , opening on September 1 , 1897 .
It was originally built to get streetcar lines off the traffic-clogged streets , instead of as a true rapid transit line .
It now forms the central part of the Green Line , connecting Boylston Street to Park Street and Government Center stations .
The tunnel originally served five closely spaced stations : Boylston , Park Street , Scollay Square , Adams Square , and Haymarket , with branches to the Public Garden Portal and Pleasant Street Incline south of Boylston .
Park Street , Scollay Square , and Haymarket stations were altered over the next two decades as transfers were added to the Cambridge-Dorchester Subway , East Boston Tunnel , and Main Line Elevated -LRB- now part of the Red , Blue , and Orange Lines , respectively -RRB- .
In 1962 , the southern portal at Pleasant Street was closed ; the following year , the northern half of the tunnel was substantially altered when Government Center and a new Boston City Hall replaced Scollay Square and Adams Square .
The northbound tunnel to Haymarket station was rerouted ; the southbound tunnel is still original .
Scollay Square station was rebuilt as Government Center , and Adams Square station was closed .
In 1971 , the original Haymarket station was replaced with a new station just to the south .
