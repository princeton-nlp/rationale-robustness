Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , shortened Hogwarts , is a fictional British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen , and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series .
Rowling has suggested that she may have inadvertently taken the name from the hogwort plant -LRB- Croton capitatus -RRB- , which she had seen at Kew Gardens some time before writing the series , although the names `` The Hogwarts '' and `` Hoggwart '' appear in the 1954 Nigel Molesworth book How To Be Topp by Geoffrey Willans .
Hogwarts school was voted as the 36th best Scottish educational establishment in a 2008 online ranking , outranking Edinburgh 's Loretto School .
According to a director of the Independent Schools Network Rankings , it was added to the schools listing `` for fun '' and was then voted on .
