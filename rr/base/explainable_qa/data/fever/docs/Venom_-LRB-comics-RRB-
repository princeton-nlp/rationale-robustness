Venom , or the Venom Symbiote , is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics , commonly in association with Spider-Man .
Venom made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man # 300 -LRB- May 1988 -RRB- .
Venom was originally conceived as a supervillain , but has since become more of an antihero .
Venom is a Symbiote , a sentient alien , with a gooey , almost liquid-like form .
As with real-world symbiotes , it requires a host , usually human , to bond with for its survival .
After bonding , the Symbiote endows its enhanced powers upon the host .
When the Venom Symbiote bonds with a human , that new dual-life form refers to itself as `` Venom '' .
The Venom Symbiote 's first known host was Spider-Man , who eventually separated himself from the creature when he discovered its true nature .
The Symbiote went on to merge with other hosts , most notably Eddie Brock , its second and most infamous host , with whom it first became Venom and one of Spider-Man 's archenemies .
According to S.H.I.E.L.D. , it is considered one of the greatest threats to humanity , alongside Magneto , Doctor Doom , and Red Skull .
Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character : `` What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger 's greatest nightmares . ''
