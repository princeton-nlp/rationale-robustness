His travels are recorded in Livres des merveilles du monde -LRB- Book of the Marvels of the World , also known as The Travels of Marco Polo , c. 1300 -RRB- , a book that described to Europeans the wealth and great size of China , its capital Peking , and other Asian cities and countries .
He learned the mercantile trade from his father and uncle , Niccolò and Maffeo , who travelled through Asia and met Kublai Khan .
In 1269 , they returned to Venice to meet Marco for the first time .
The three of them embarked on an epic journey to Asia , returning after 24 years to find Venice at war with Genoa ; Marco was imprisoned and dictated his stories to a cellmate .
He was released in 1299 , became a wealthy merchant , married , and had three children .
He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice .
Marco Polo was not the first European to reach China -LRB- see Europeans in Medieval China -RRB- , but he was the first to leave a detailed chronicle of his experience .
This book inspired Christopher Columbus and many other travellers .
There is a substantial literature based on Polo 's writings ; he also influenced European cartography , leading to the introduction of the Fra Mauro map .
