Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors , or mAChRs , are acetylcholine receptors that form G protein-receptor complexes in the cell membranes of certain neurons and other cells .
They play several roles , including acting as the main end-receptor stimulated by acetylcholine released from postganglionic fibers in the parasympathetic nervous system .
Muscarinic receptors were named as such because they are more sensitive to muscarine than to nicotine .
Their counterparts are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors -LRB- nAChRs -RRB- , receptor ion channels that are also important in the autonomic nervous system .
Many drugs and other substances -LRB- for example pilocarpine and scopolamine -RRB- manipulate these two distinct receptors by acting as selective agonists or antagonists .
