Andrew Patrick Wood -LRB- January 8 , 1966 -- March 19 , 1990 -RRB- was an American musician best known as the lead singer for alternative rock bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone .
Wood was also known for his flamboyance .
Wood formed Malfunkshun in 1980 with his brother Kevin and Regan Hagar .
The band used alter ego personas onstage , with Wood using the name Landrew the Love Child .
Though the band only had two songs released , `` With Yo ' Heart -LRB- Not Yo ' Hands -RRB- '' and `` Stars-n-You '' , on the Deep Six compilation album , they are often cited as being among the `` founding fathers '' of the Seattle 's grunge movement .
During his time in Malfunkshun , Wood started relying heavily on drugs , entering rehab in 1985 .
By 1988 , Malfunkshun had disbanded and Wood began jamming with Green River members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament .
They soon began writing original material and formed Mother Love Bone the same year , adding guitarist Bruce Fairweather -LRB- also a former member of Green River -RRB- and drummer Greg Gilmore to the lineup .
The following year , the band signed a deal with PolyGram , issuing a six-song EP , Shine , before going on to tour , supporting The Dogs D'Amour .
Towards the end of the year , the band recorded their debut album , Apple , which was scheduled for release in 1990 .
Due to his struggle with drug addiction , Wood checked himself into rehab in 1989 , hoping to get clean for the release of Mother Love Bone 's debut album .
On March 16 , 1990 , Wood was found in a comatose state by his girlfriend , Xana La Fuente , having overdosed on heroin .
Wood was taken to the hospital and placed on life support .
Wood 's condition had shown signs of improvement but he died three days later .
