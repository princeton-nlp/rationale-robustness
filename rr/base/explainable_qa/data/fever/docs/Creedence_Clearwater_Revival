Creedence Clearwater Revival , often informally abbreviated to Creedence or CCR , was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
The band consisted of lead vocalist , lead guitarist , and primary songwriter John Fogerty , his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty , bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford .
Their musical style encompassed the roots rock , swamp rock , and blues rock genres .
Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins , they played in a Southern rock style , with lyrics about bayous , catfish , the Mississippi River , and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography , as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War .
The band performed at 1969 's famed Woodstock Festival .
After four years of chart-topping success , the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 .
Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year , and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control , all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former bandmates .
Fogerty 's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz , owner of their label Fantasy Records , created further protracted court battles .
As a result , John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR 's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
Creedence Clearwater Revival 's music is still a staple of U.S. radio airplay ; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone .
Rolling Stone ranked the band 82nd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time .
