The Cretaceous -LRB- -LSB- pronkrᵻˈteɪʃəs -RSB- , -RRB- is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago -LRB- Mya -RRB- to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya .
It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era .
The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K , for its German translation Kreide -LRB- chalk -RRB- .
The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate , resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas .
These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles , ammonites and rudists , while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land .
During this time , new groups of mammals and birds , as well as flowering plants , appeared .
The Cretaceous ended with a large mass extinction , the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event , in which many groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , pterosaurs and large marine reptiles died out .
The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous -- Paleogene boundary -LRB- K -- Pg boundary -RRB- , a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction which lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras .
