A floppy disk , also called a floppy , diskette or just disk , is a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium , sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles .
Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive -LRB- FDD -RRB- .
Floppy disks , initially as 8 inch media and later in 5 1/4 - inch -LRB- 133 mm -RRB- and 3 1/2 - inch -LRB- 90 mm -RRB- sizes , were a ubiquitous form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the mid-2000s .
By the late 2000s , computers were rarely manufactured with installed floppy disk drives ; 3 1/2 - inch floppy disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive , but USB drives for 5 1/4 - inch , 8-inch , and non-standard diskettes are rare to non-existent .
These formats are usually handled by older equipment .
While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses , especially with legacy industrial computer equipment , they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater capacity , such as USB flash drives , flash storage cards , portable external hard disk drives , optical discs , ROM cartridges and storage available through computer networks .
