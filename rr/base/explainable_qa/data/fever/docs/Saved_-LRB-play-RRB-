Saved is a play by Edward Bond which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre , London in November 1965 .
The play itself is set in London during the 1960s .
Its subject is the cultural poverty and frustration of a generation of young people on the dole and living on council estates .
In response to the censorship of the play , Laurence Olivier wrote a letter to The Observer , saying that : `` Saved is not a play for children but it is for grown-ups , and the grown-ups of this country should have the courage to look at it . ''
U.S. novelist Mary McCarthy praised its `` remarkable delicacy '' .
Saved was originally refused a licence without severe cuts by the Lord Chamberlain .
When it was performed to large private audiences , the Lord Chamberlain decided to prosecute those who were involved in the production of the play .
Although the defendants pleaded guilty and were fined , the case reflected badly on the censorship office and was pivotal in the abolition of theatre censorship a few years later in 1968 .
The original cast included John Castle , Tony Selby , Ronald Pickup , Dennis Waterman , William Stewart , Barbara Ferris , Lucy Fleming , Gwen Nelson and Alison Fraser .
The creative team included : director William Gaskill and lighting by Eric Baker .
In February 1969 , after the abolition of censorship in the 1968 Theatres Act , Saved was given its first full public run at the Royal Court Theatre in London .
The revival cast included : Malcolm Tierney -LRB- as Len -RRB- , Kenneth Cranham -LRB- as Fred -RRB- , Patricia Franklin -LRB- as Pam -RRB- , Queenie Watts -LRB- as Mary -RRB- , Tom Chadbon , Peter Blythe and William Gaskill was the director .
The play is rarely revived , though its theme of social disenfranchisement is seen by Bond as very relevant to the present day .
In October 2011 , the play was revived in London for the first time in 27 years , at the Lyric Hammersmith , directed by Sean Holmes .
