Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries -LRB- Juniperus communis -RRB- .
From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages , gin has evolved from use in herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry .
Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever , and became popular in Great Britain -LRB- particularly in London -RRB- when William of Orange , leader of the Dutch Republic , occupied the English , Scottish , and Irish thrones with his wife Mary .
Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits , represented by products of various origins , styles , and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient .
