The English are a nation and an ethnic group native to England , who speak the English language .
The English identity is of early medieval origin , when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn -LRB- `` family of the Angles '' -RRB- .
Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles , one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD .
England is one of the countries of the United Kingdom .
Historically , the English population is descended from several peoples -- the earlier Britons -LRB- or Brythons -RRB- and the Germanic tribes that settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans , including Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians .
Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become England -LRB- from the Old English Englaland -RRB- along with the later Danes , Normans and other groups .
In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England was succeeded by the Kingdom of Great Britain .
Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general .
Today many English people have recent forebears from other parts of the United Kingdom , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other European countries and from the Commonwealth .
The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis .
These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire .
