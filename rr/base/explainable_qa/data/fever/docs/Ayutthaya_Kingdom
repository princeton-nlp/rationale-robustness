Ayutthaya was friendly towards foreign traders , including the Chinese , Vietnamese , Indians , Japanese and Persians , and later the Portuguese , Spaniards , Dutch , English and French , permitting them to set up villages outside the walls of the capital , also called Ayutthaya .
In the sixteenth century , it was described by foreign traders as one of the biggest and wealthiest cities in the East .
The court of King Narai -LRB- 1656 -- 88 -RRB- had strong links with that of King Louis XIV of France , whose ambassadors compared the city in size and wealth to Paris .
By 1550 , the kingdom 's vassals included some city-states in the Malay Peninsula , Sukhothai , Lan Na and parts of Burma and Cambodia .
This part of the Kingdom 's history is sometimes referred to as ` The Ayutthayan Empire . '
In foreign accounts , Ayutthaya was called Siam , but many sources say the people of Ayutthaya called themselves Tai , and their kingdom Krung Tai `` The Tai country '' .
