Greenwich -LRB- -LSB- ˈɡrɛnɪtʃ -RSB- , -LSB- ˈɡrɪnɪdʒ -RSB- , -LSB- ˈɡrɪnɪtʃ -RSB- or -LSB- ˈɡrɛnɪdʒ -RSB- -RRB- is an early-established district of south east London , England , centred 5.5 miles -LRB- 8.9 km -RRB- east south-east of Charing Cross .
The town lends its name to the Royal Borough of Greenwich .
The town gives its name to one of the five boroughs of the London Docklands , and is connected to areas with docks of London historically by river and today to Canary Wharf and other districts by the Docklands Light Railway .
Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian -LRB- 0 ° longitude -RRB- and Greenwich Mean Time .
The town became the site of a royal palace , the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century , and was the birthplace of many Tudors , including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I .
The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was rebuilt as the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor .
These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873 , and they remained an establishment for military education until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation .
The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public ; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance .
The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there , such as Vanbrugh Castle -LRB- 1717 -RRB- established on Maze Hill , next to the park .
From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre .
The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century , with the siting of the Cutty Sark and Gipsy Moth IV next to the river front , and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934 .
Greenwich formed part of Kent until 1889 when the County of London was created .
