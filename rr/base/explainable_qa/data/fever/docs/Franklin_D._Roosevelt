Franklin Delano Roosevelt -LRB- -LSB- ˈroʊzəvəlt -RSB- , his own pronunciation , or -LSB- - en ˈroʊzəvɛlt -RSB- January 30 , 1882 -- April 12 , 1945 -RRB- , commonly known as FDR , was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945 .
A Democrat , he won a record four presidential elections and emerged as a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century .
He directed the United States government during most of the Great Depression and World War II .
As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System and defining American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century .
He is often rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. Presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln .
Roosevelt was born in 1882 to an old , prominent Dutch family from Dutchess County , New York and attended Groton School .
He went on to graduate from Harvard College in 1903 and attended Columbia Law School .
At age 23 in 1905 , he married Eleanor Roosevelt , and the couple went on to have six children .
He entered politics in 1910 , serving in the New York State Senate , and then as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson .
In 1920 , presidential candidate James M. Cox selected Roosevelt as his running mate , but the Cox/Roosevelt ticket lost to the Republican ticket of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge .
In 1921 , Roosevelt was stricken with debilitating polio , which cost him the use of his legs .
The disability put his future political career in jeopardy , but he attempted to recover from the illness and founded the treatment center in Warm Springs , Georgia for people with polio .
Roosevelt returned to political life when he nominated Alfred E. Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention .
At Smith 's behest , Roosevelt successfully ran for Governor of New York in 1928 .
He was in office from 1929 to 1933 and served as a reform governor , promoting the enactment of programs to combat the depression besetting the United States at the time .
In the 1932 presidential election , Roosevelt defeated incumbent Republican president Herbert Hoover in a landslide to win the presidency .
Roosevelt took office while the United States was in the midst of the worst economic crisis in its history .
Energized by his personal victory over polio , FDR relied on his persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit .
During his first 100 days in office , Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal -- a variety of programs designed to produce relief -LRB- government jobs for the unemployed -RRB- , recovery -LRB- economic growth -RRB- , and reform -LRB- through regulation of Wall Street , banks and transportation -RRB- .
He created numerous programs to support the unemployed and farmers , and to encourage labor union growth while more closely regulating business and high finance .
His support for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 added to his popularity , helping him win re-election by a landslide in 1936 .
The economy improved rapidly from 1933 -- 37 , but then relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 -- 38 .
The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court , and blocked almost all proposals for major liberal legislation -LRB- except the minimum wage , which did pass -RRB- .
When the war began and unemployment ended , conservatives in Congress repealed the two major relief programs , the Works Progress Administration -LRB- WPA -RRB- and Civilian Conservation Corps -LRB- CCC -RRB- .
However , they kept most of the regulations on business .
Along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Wagner Act , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Social Security .
With World War II looming after 1938 with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and the United Kingdom , while remaining officially neutral .
His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy '' , which would supply munitions to the Allies .
In March 1941 , Roosevelt , with Congressional approval , provided Lend-Lease aid to Britain and China .
Following the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , which he famously called `` a date which will live in infamy '' , Roosevelt sought and obtained the quick approval on the following day for Congress to declare war on Japan and , a few days later , on Germany .
Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins , and with very strong national support , he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allies against Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in World War II .
He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort , and also ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians .
As an active military leader , Roosevelt implemented a war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers , and he initiated the development of the world 's first atomic bomb .
His work also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods .
Roosevelt 's physical health seriously declined during the war years , and he died weeks into his fourth term .
He was then succeeded by his vice president Harry S. Truman , and a few months after Truman 's inauguration , the United States bombed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , leading to Japan 's surrender .
