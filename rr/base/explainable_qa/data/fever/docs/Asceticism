Asceticism -LRB- -LSB- əˈsɛtɪsɪzəm -RSB- from the -LSB- Wiktionary : ἄσκησις , ἄσκησις -RSB- áskesis , `` exercise '' or `` training '' -RRB- is a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly pleasures , often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals .
Ascetics may withdraw from the world for their practices or continue to be part of their society , but typically adopt a frugal lifestyle , characterised by the renunciation of material possessions and physical pleasures , and time spent fasting while concentrating on the practice of religion or reflection upon spiritual matters .
Asceticism is classified into two types .
`` Natural asceticism '' consists of a lifestyle where material aspects of life are reduced to utmost simplicity and a minimum but without maiming the body or harsher austerities that make the body suffer , while `` unnatural asceticism '' is defined as a practice that involves body mortification and self infliction of pain such as by sleeping on a bed of nails .
Asceticism has been historically observed in many religious traditions , including Buddhism , Christianity , Hinduism , Jainism and Judaism .
Mainstream Islam has lacked asceticism , except for its minority Sufi sect whose long tradition has included strict asceticism .
The practitioners of these religions eschewed worldly pleasures and led an abstinent lifestyle , in the pursuit of redemption , salvation or spirituality .
Asceticism is seen in the ancient theologies as a journey towards spiritual transformation , where the simple is sufficient , the bliss is within , the frugal is plenty .
