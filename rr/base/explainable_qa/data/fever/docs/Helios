Helios -LRB- -LSB- ˈhiːli.ɒs -RSB- Ἥλιος Hēlios ; Latinized as Helius ; Ἠέλιος in Homeric Greek -RRB- was the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology .
He is the son of the Titan Hyperion and the Titaness Theia -LRB- according to Hesiod -RRB- , also known as Euryphaessa -LRB- in Homeric Hymn 31 -RRB- and brother of the goddesses Selene , the moon , and Eos , the dawn .
Helios was described as a handsome titan crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun , who drove the chariot of the sun across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night .
In the Homeric hymn to Helios , Helios is said to drive a golden chariot drawn by steeds -LRB- HH 31.14 -- 15 -RRB- ; and Pindar speaks of Helios 's `` fire-darting steeds '' -LRB- Olympian Ode 7.71 -RRB- .
Still later , the horses were given fire related names : Pyrois , Aeos , Aethon , and Phlegon .
As time passed , Helios was increasingly identified with the god of light , Apollo .
However , in spite of their syncretism , they were also often viewed as two distinct gods/titan -LRB- Helios was a Titan , whereas Apollo was an Olympian -RRB- .
The equivalent of Helios in Roman mythology was Sol .
