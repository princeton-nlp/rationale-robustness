Down with Love is a 2003 romantic comedy film .
It was directed by Peyton Reed , written by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake , and stars Ren√©e Zellweger , Ewan McGregor , Sarah Paulson and David Hyde Pierce .
The story follows a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario and the patriarchal , even male chauvinist society of the 1950s and early 1960s .
The film is a pastiche of the sex comedies that were popular in the era in which Down with Love is set , in particular the three films that starred Doris Day and Rock Hudson : 1959 's Pillow Talk , 1961 's Lover Come Back and 1964 's Send Me No Flowers .
