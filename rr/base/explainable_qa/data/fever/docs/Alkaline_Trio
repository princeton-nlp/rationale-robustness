Founded in late 1996 by Skiba , bassist Rob Doran , and drummer Glenn Porter , Alkaline Trio released its debut single , `` Sundials '' , in 1997 .

The band subsequently recorded an EP , For Your Lungs Only -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , and its debut studio album , Goddamnit -LRB- 1998 -RRB- .

Backed by the singles `` Stupid Kid '' and `` Private Eye '' , From Here to Infirmary significantly increased the band 's exposure , and its follow-up , Good Mourning -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , charted highly on the Billboard 200 .
Good Mourning marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant .
In 2005 , the band released Crimson which expanded upon the band 's punk rock influences , with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation , and continued with this direction on Agony & Irony -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , which was released on V2 Records .
In 2010 , the band released This Addiction on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph .
Recorded in the band 's home town of Chicago , with early producer Matt Allison , the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots ; it became the highest charting album of their career , debuting on the Billboard 200 at No. 11 .
