Lafayette Ronald Hubbard -LRB- March 13 , 1911 -- January 24 , 1986 -RRB- , better known as L. Ron Hubbard -LRB- -LSB- ɛl_rɒn_ˈhʌˌbərd -RSB- -RRB- and often referred to by his initials , LRH , was an American author and the founder of the Church of Scientology .
In 2014 , Hubbard was cited by the Smithsonian magazine as one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time , as one of the eleven religious figures on that list .
After establishing a career as a writer , becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories , he developed a system called Dianetics which was first expounded in book form in May 1950 .
He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology .
His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration , literacy and drug rehabilitation .
The Church 's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most translated and published author in the world .
The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard .
Although many aspects of Hubbard 's life story are disputed , there is general agreement about its basic outline .
Born in Tilden , Nebraska , he spent much of his childhood in Helena , Montana .
He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father , an officer in the United States Navy , was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam .
He attended George Washington University in Washington , D.C. at the start of the 1930s , before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories .
He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II , briefly commanding two ships , the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815 .
He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command .
The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital , being treated for a duodenal ulcer .
After the war , Hubbard developed a philosophy he called Dianetics , which he called `` the modern science of mental health '' .
He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization .
During the late 1960s and early 1970s , he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as `` Commodore '' of the Sea Organization , an elite inner group of Scientologists .
His expedition came to an end when Britain , Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Venezuela all closed their ports to his fleet .
At one point , a court in Australia revoked the Church 's status as a religion , though it was later reinstated .
Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert .
In 1978 , a trial court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud in absentia .
Others convictions from the same trial were reversed on appeal , but Hubbard died before the court considered his case .
In 1983 L. Ron Hubbard was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an international information infiltration and theft project called `` Operation Snow White '' .
He spent the remaining years of his life on his ranch , the `` Whispering Wind , '' near Creston , California , where he died in 1986 .
A small group of Scientology officials and physician Dr. Eugene Denk attended to him before his death , for a number of ailments including chronic pancreatitis .
In 1986 , he died at age 74 in a 1982 Blue Bird motor home , which was situated on his property .
The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms , and he portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer , world traveler , and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines , including photography , art , poetry , and philosophy .
In Scientology publications , he is referred to as `` Founder '' and `` Source '' of Scientology and Dianetics .
His critics , including his own son Ronald DeWolf , have characterized him as a liar , a charlatan , and mentally unstable , though DeWolf later repudiated those statements .
Though many of Hubbard 's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious , the Church rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard 's life is not historical fact .
