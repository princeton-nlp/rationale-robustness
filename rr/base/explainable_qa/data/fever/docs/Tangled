Tangled is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy-comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures .
Loosely based on the German fairy tale `` Rapunzel '' in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm , it is the 50th Disney animated feature film .
Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi , the film tells the story of a lost , young princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower .
Against her mother 's wishes , she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen .
Before the film 's release , its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral .
Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $ 260 million , which if accurate , would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time .
The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery -LRB- CGI -RRB- and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting .
Composer Alan Menken , who had worked on prior Disney animated features , returned to score Tangled .
Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14 , 2010 , and went into general release on November 24 .
The film was well received by critics and audiences alike .
The film earned $ 591 million in worldwide box office revenue , $ 200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada .
The film was nominated for a number of awards , including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards .
