Elizabeth of York -LRB- 11 February 1466 -- 11 February 1503 -RRB- was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death .
As the wife of Henry VII , she was the first Tudor queen .
She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III , and she married the king following Henry 's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses .
She was the mother of King Henry VIII .
Therefore , she was the daughter , sister , niece , wife , mother and grandmother of successive Kings of England .
The period of Henry VI 's readaption from October 1470 until April 1471 and the period between her father 's death in 1483 , when she was 17 , and the making of peace between her mother and her uncle Richard were violent and anxious interludes in what was mostly a peaceful life .
Her two brothers disappeared , the `` Princes in the Tower '' , their fate unknown .
She was welcomed back to court by her Uncle Richard III , along with all of her sisters .
As a Yorkist princess , the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster , but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry her before he arrived in England ; this was an important move , which , however , failed to bring him the desired Yorkist support .
Her marriage seems to have been successful , though her eldest son Arthur , Prince of Wales , died at age 15 in 1502 , and three other children died young .
She seems to have played little part in politics .
Her surviving children became a King of England and queens of France and Scotland ; it is through the Scottish Stuart dynasty that her many modern royal descendants trace their descent from her .
