Efraim Diveroli -LRB- born December 20 , 1985 -RRB- is an American former arms dealer and author .
His company , AEY Inc. , was a major weapons contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense .
The U.S. government suspended AEY for violating its contract after AEY provided 42-year-old substandard and unserviceable Chinese ammunition and attempted to re-brand and re-package it , thus violating the American arms embargo against China .
As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers -- Diveroli was 21 and partner David Packouz was 25 when AEY landed the ammunition deal -- the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures .
Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison .
He is a subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips drama comedy film , War Dogs , in which he is portrayed by Jonah Hill .
