Monosodium glutamate -LRB- MSG , also known as sodium glutamate -RRB- is the sodium salt of glutamic acid , one of the most abundant naturally occurring non-essential amino acids .
Monosodium glutamate is found naturally in tomatoes , cheese and other foods .
MSG is used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer with an umami taste that intensifies the meaty , savory flavor of food , as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups .
It was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda , who was trying to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of kombu , an edible seaweed used as a base for many Japanese soups .
MSG as a flavor enhancer balances , blends , and rounds the perception of other tastes .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given MSG its generally recognized as safe -LRB- GRAS -RRB- designation .
A popular belief is that large doses of MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort , known as `` Chinese restaurant syndrome , '' but double-blind tests fail to find evidence of such a reaction .
The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits .
MSG has the HS code 29224220 and the E number E621 .
