Cléopâtre is an opera in four acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Louis Payen .
It was first performed at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo on 23 February 1914 , nearly two years after Massenet 's death .
Cléopâtre is one of three operas by Massenet to be premiered posthumously ; the others are Panurge -LRB- 1913 -RRB- and Amadis -LRB- 1922 -RRB- .
The piece has seen limited revival since its premiere and has a modest modern recording history .
