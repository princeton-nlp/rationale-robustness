Middle-earth is the fictional setting of much of British writer J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium .
The term is equivalent to the term Midgard of Norse mythology , describing the human-inhabited world , i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien 's imagined mythological past .
Tolkien 's most widely read works , The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , take place entirely in Middle-earth , and Middle-earth has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its fictional universe .
Within his stories , Tolkien translated the name `` Middle-earth '' as Endor -LRB- or sometimes Endórë -RRB- and Ennor in the Elvish languages Quenya and Sindarin respectively , sometimes referring only to the continent that the stories take place on , with another southern continent called the Dark Land .
Middle-earth is the north continent of Earth -LRB- Arda -RRB- in an imaginary period of the Earth 's past
-LRB- Tolkien placed the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own time -RRB- , in the sense of a `` secondary or sub-creational reality '' .
Its general position is reminiscent of Europe , with the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England -LRB- more specifically , the West Midlands , with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford -RRB- .
