Henry Louis `` Buster '' Gehrig -LRB- born Heinrich Ludwig Gehrig ; June 19 , 1903June 2 , 1941 -RRB- was an American baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- for the New York Yankees , from 1923 through 1939 .
Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability , a trait that earned him his nickname `` The Iron Horse '' .
He was an All-Star seven consecutive times , a Triple Crown winner once , an American League -LRB- AL -RRB- Most Valuable Player twice , and a member of six World Series champion teams .
He had a career .340 batting average , .632 slugging average , and a .447 on base average .
He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in -LRB- RBI -RRB- .
In 1939 , he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number -LRB- 4 -RRB- retired by a team .
A native of New York City and attendee of Columbia University , Gehrig signed with the Yankees in 1923 .
He set several major league records during his career , including the most career grand slams -LRB- 23 -RRB- -LRB- since broken by Alex Rodriguez -RRB- and most consecutive games played -LRB- 2,130 -RRB- , a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken , Jr. in 1995 .
Gehrig 's streak ended on May 2 , 1939 , when he voluntarily took himself out of the lineup to stunned fans after his play was hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- ALS -RRB- , an incurable neuromuscular disorder now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
The disease forced him to retire at age 36 and was the cause of his death two years later .
The pathos of his farewell from baseball was capped off by his iconic 1939 `` Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth '' speech at Yankee Stadium .
Gehrig was voted the greatest first baseman of all time by the Baseball Writers ' Association in 1969 , and was the leading vote-getter on the Major League Baseball All-Century Team chosen by fans in 1999 .
A monument in Gehrig 's honor , originally dedicated by the Yankees in 1941 , currently resides in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium .
The Lou Gehrig Memorial Award is given annually to the MLB player best exhibiting his integrity and character .
