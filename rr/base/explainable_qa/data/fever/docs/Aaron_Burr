Aaron Burr Jr. -LRB- February 6 , 1756September 14 , 1836 -RRB- was an American politician .
He was the third Vice President of the United States -LRB- 1801 -- 1805 -RRB- , serving during Thomas Jefferson 's first term .
Burr served as a Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War , after which he became a successful lawyer and politician .
He was elected twice to the New York State Assembly -LRB- 1784 -- 1785 , 1798 -- 1799 -RRB- , was appointed New York State Attorney General -LRB- 1789 -- 1791 -RRB- , was chosen as a U.S. senator -LRB- 1791 -- 1797 -RRB- , from the State of New York , and reached the apex of his career as vice president .
The highlight of Burr 's tenure as president of the Senate , one of his few official duties as vice president , was the Senate 's first impeachment trial , that of Supreme Court justice Samuel Chase .
In 1804 , the last full year of his single term as vice president , Burr killed his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel .
Burr was never tried for the illegal duel , and all charges against him were eventually dropped , but Hamilton 's death ended Burr 's political career .
After leaving Washington , Burr traveled west seeking new opportunities , both economic and political .
His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807 .
The subsequent trial resulted in acquittal , but Burr 's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends .
In a final quest for grand opportunities , he left the United States for Europe .
He remained overseas until 1812 , when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City .
There he spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity .
