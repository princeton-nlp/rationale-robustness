Francis I -LRB- François Ier -RRB- -LRB- 12 September 1494 -- 31 March 1547 -RRB- was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois , reigning from 1515 until his death .
He was the son of Charles , Count of Angoulême , and Louise of Savoy .
He succeeded his cousin and father-in-law Louis XII , who died without a male heir .
A prodigious patron of the arts , he initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists to work on the Château de Chambord , including Leonardo da Vinci , who brought the Mona Lisa with him , which Francis had acquired .
Francis ' reign saw important cultural changes with the rise of absolute monarchy in France , the spread of humanism and Protestantism , and the beginning of French exploration of the New World .
Jacques Cartier and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first French colonial empire .
For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language , he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres -LRB- the `` Father and Restorer of Letters '' -RRB- .
He was also known as François au Grand Nez -LRB- `` Francis of the Large Nose '' -RRB- , the Grand Colas , and the Roi-Chevalier -LRB- the `` Knight-King '' -RRB- for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain Charles V.
Following the policy of his predecessors , Francis continued the Italian Wars .
The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands , the throne of Spain , and his subsequent election as Holy Roman Emperor , meant that France was geographically encircled by the Habsburg monarchy .
In his struggle against Imperial hegemony , he sought the support of Henry VIII of England at the Field of the Cloth of Gold .
When this was unsuccessful , he formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Muslim sultan Suleiman the Magnificent , a controversial move for a Christian king at the time .
