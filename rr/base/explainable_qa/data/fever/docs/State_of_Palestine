The State of Palestine , also known simply as Palestine , is a de jure sovereign state in the Middle East that is recognized by 136 UN members and since 2012 has a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations -- which amounts to a de facto , or implicit , recognition of statehood .
The State of Palestine claims the West Bank -LRB- bordering Israel and Jordan -RRB- and Gaza Strip -LRB- bordering Israel and Egypt -RRB- with East Jerusalem as the designated capital .
Most of the areas claimed by the State of Palestine have been occupied by Israel since 1967 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War .
Its independence was declared on 15 November 1988 by the Palestine Liberation Organization -LRB- PLO -RRB- in Algiers as a government-in-exile .
