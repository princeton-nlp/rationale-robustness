A Good Day to Die Hard is a 2013 American action thriller film and the fifth installment in the Die Hard film series .
The film was directed by John Moore and written by Skip Woods , and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane .
The main plot finds McClane travelling to Russia to get his estranged son , Jack , an undercover CIA agent , out of prison .
He is soon caught in the crossfire of a global terrorist plot .
Alongside Willis , the film also stars Jai Courtney , Cole Hauser , Yuliya Snigir and Sebastian Koch as the film 's villain .
Talks of a fifth Die Hard film began before the release of the fourth installment , Live Free or Die Hard , with Willis affirming that the latter would not be the last in the series , but pre-production did not start until September 2011 , when John Moore was officially announced as the director .
Filming began in April 2012 , primarily in Budapest , Hungary .
A Good Day to Die Hard premiered in Los Angeles on January 31 , 2013 , coinciding with the unveiling of a Die Hard mural at the Fox Lot , and was released in certain East and Southeast Asian countries on February 7 and in the United States and Canada on February 13 .
It is the first Die Hard film to use Dolby Atmos Surround Mixing and the first to also be released in IMAX theaters .
Unlike the previous films , A Good Day to Die Hard was a critical failure , receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews which cited implausible action sequences , a cliched script , a weak plot , Moore 's direction , and a lack of characterization , although the special effects were praised .
It is the first film produced by TSG Entertainment , since distributor 20th Century Fox 's departure from Dune Entertainment upon the completion of their distribution contract at the end of 2012 .
A sequel entitled Die Hard : Year One was confirmed to be in works while also intended to be an origin story of John McClane .
