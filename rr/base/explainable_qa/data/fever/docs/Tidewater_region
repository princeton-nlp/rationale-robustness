The Tidewater region is a geographic area of southeast Virginia and northeastern North Carolina , part of the Atlantic coastal plain in the United States of America .
Portions of Maryland facing the Chesapeake Bay are also given this designation .
The area gains its name because of the effects of the changing tides on local rivers , sounds , and the ocean .
