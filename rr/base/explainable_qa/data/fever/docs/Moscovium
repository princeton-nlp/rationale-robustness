Moscovium is a superheavy synthetic element with symbol Mc and atomic number 115 .
It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research -LRB- JINR -RRB- in Dubna , Russia .
In December 2015 , it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP .
On 28 November 2016 , it was officially named after the Moscow region , which the JINR is situated in .
Moscovium is an extremely radioactive element : its most stable known isotope , moscovium-290 , has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds .
In the periodic table , it is a p-block transactinide element .
It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen , although it has not been confirmed to behave as a heavier homologue of the pnictogen bismuth .
Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues , nitrogen , phosphorus , arsenic , antimony , and bismuth , and to be a post-transition metal , although it should also show several major differences from them .
About 100 atoms of moscovium have been observed to date , all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290 .
