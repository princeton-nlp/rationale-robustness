Maharaja Duleep Singh , GCSI -LRB- 6 September 1838 -- 22 October 1893 -RRB- , also known as Dalip Singh and later in life nicknamed the Black Prince of Perthshire , was the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire .
He was Maharaja Ranjit Singh 's youngest son , the only child of Maharani Jind Kaur .
After the assassinations of four of his predecessors , he came to power in September 1843 , at the age of five .
For a while , his mother ruled as Regent , but in December 1846 , after the First Anglo-Sikh War , she was replaced by a British Resident and imprisoned .
Mother and son were not allowed to meet again for thirteen and a half years .
In April 1849 ten-year-old Duleep was put in the care of Dr John Login .
He was exiled to Britain at age 15 and was befriended and much admired by Queen Victoria , who is reported to have written of the Punjabi Maharaja : `` Those eyes and those teeth are too beautiful '' .
The Queen was godmother to several of his children .
In 1856 , he tried to contact his mother , but his letter and emissaries were intercepted by the British in India , and did not reach her .
However , he persisted and , with help from Login , was allowed to meet her on 16 January 1861 at Spence 's Hotel in Calcutta and return with her to the United Kingdom .
During the last two years of her life , his mother told the Maharaja about his Sikh heritage and the Empire which once had been his to rule .
