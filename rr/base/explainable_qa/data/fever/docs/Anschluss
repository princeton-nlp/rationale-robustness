Anschluss -LRB- -LSB- ˈʔanʃlʊs -RSB- , `` connection '' or `` joining '' -RRB- is the term used to describe the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany on 12 March 1938 .
German spelling , until the German orthography reform of 1996 , was Anschluß and it was also known as the Anschluss Österreichs -LRB- , Austrian Annexation -RRB- .
The idea of an Anschluss -LRB- Austria and Germany united to form a `` Greater Germany '' -RRB- began after the Unification of Germany excluded Austria and the Austrian Germans from the Prussian-dominated German nation-state in 1871 .
Following the end of World War I with the fall of the Austria-Hungarian Empire , in 1918 , the newly formed Republic of German-Austria attempted union with Germany , but the Treaty of Saint Germain -LRB- 10 September 1919 -RRB- and the Treaty of Versailles -LRB- 28 June 1919 -RRB- forbade both the union and the continued use of the name `` German-Austria '' -LRB- Deutschösterreich -RRB- and cutting several territories like the Sudetenland off .
