Richard B. Riddick , more commonly known as Riddick , is a fictional character and the antihero of four films in the Riddick series -LRB- Pitch Black , The Chronicles of Riddick , the animated movie The Chronicles of Riddick : Dark Fury , and Riddick -RRB- , as well as the two video games The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape from Butcher Bay and The Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena .
Actor Vin Diesel has played the title role in all of the Riddick-based films and video games so far .
Within the canon of the series , Riddick is shown to be a highly skilled predator -- he is extremely mobile and stealthy - especially for someone of his size , has a vast knowledge of how to kill almost any humanoid in a variety of ways , is an extreme survivalist , and is notoriously hard to contain .
He is also self-admittedly a dangerous convict and murderer -- yet despite this , he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions , usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature .
Riddick is a Furyan , a member of a warrior race obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate , and is one of the last of his kind .
One of his most defining features are his eyes , a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species -LRB- the Alpha-Furyans -RRB- , although he implies in Pitch Black that they were `` shined '' by a back-alley surgical operation .
This allows him to see clearly in the dark , but also makes him vulnerable to strong light ; he wears tinted welding goggles for protection .
Riddick was once a mercenary , then part of a security force , and later a soldier .
He is also an experienced pilot .
