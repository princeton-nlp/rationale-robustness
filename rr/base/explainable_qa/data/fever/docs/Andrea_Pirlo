Andrea Pirlo , Ufficiale OMRI -LRB- born 19 May 1979 -RRB- is an Italian professional footballer who plays for American club New York City FC and the Italy national team .
Pirlo is usually deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield for both his club and national sides , and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position , due to his vision , ball control , creativity and passing ability ; he is also a free-kick specialist .
Pirlo began his club career as an attacking midfielder with his home-town side Brescia , where he later helped the team to win the Serie B title and obtain Serie A promotion in 1997 .
His promising performances led to a move to Internazionale in 1998 , but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club , due to his lack of pace , as well as heavy competition with other players in his position , and was subsequently sent on loan in 1999 .
Despite successful spells with Reggina , and Brescia once again , Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter 's starting line-up , and was sold to cross-city rivals Milan in 2001 .
At Milan , manager Carlo Ancelotti decided to shift Pirlo in front of the defence as a deep-lying playmaker , which allowed him more time on the ball to orchestrate his team 's attacks .
Pirlo excelled in his new role , and soon developed into a world-class midfielder , playing a key role in Milan 's subsequent successes , as he won two UEFA Champions Leagues -LRB- 2003 and 2007 -RRB- , two UEFA Super Cups -LRB- 2003 and 2007 -RRB- , two Serie A titles -LRB- 2004 and 2011 -RRB- , a FIFA Club World Cup -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , a Supercoppa Italiana -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , and a Coppa Italia -LRB- 2003 -RRB- with the club .
After joining Juventus on a free transfer in 2011 , who had gone trophyless since 2003 , he added four more Serie A titles -LRB- 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 -RRB- , which he won consecutively , as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles -LRB- 2012 and 2013 -RRB- , and a Coppa Italia -LRB- 2015 -RRB- .
After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons , Pirlo joined MLS expansion side New York City FC in 2015 , helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second season .
At international level , Pirlo is the fourth-most capped player in the history of the Italian national team with 116 caps .
He has played for the Italian youth teams at U15 , U18 and U21 level , captaining and leading the latter to victory in the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament .

Later , he was instrumental in their victory in the 2006 FIFA World Cup .
He was named Man of the Match three times , including the final , more than any other player in the tournament , and ultimately won the Bronze Ball -LRB- awarded to the third best player of the tournament -RRB- also being elected to the Team of the Tournament .
He was also elected as part of the UEFA Euro 2012 Team of the Tournament , after leading Italy to the final , winning three Man of the Match awards in the process , the most of any player along with Andr√©s Iniesta .
He has also represented the Italian senior side at the 2004 and 2008 UEFA European Championships , the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups , and the 2009 and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cups , finishing third in the latter edition in Brazil , where he was also elected to the Team of the Tournament .
