Earth -LRB- from Eorðe -LSB- Γαῖα , Gaia -RSB- Terra -RRB- , otherwise known as the World or the Globe , is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life .
It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets .
According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence , Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago .
Earth 's gravity interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon , Earth 's only natural satellite .
During one orbit around the Sun , Earth rotates about its axis over 365 times ; thus , an Earth year is about 365.26 days long .
Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface .
The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides , stabilizes the Earth 's orientation on its axis , and gradually slows its rotation .
Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years .
About 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered with water , mostly by its oceans .
The remaining 29 % is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes , rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere .
The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack .
Earth 's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth 's magnetic field , and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics .
Within the first billion years of Earth 's history , life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth 's atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms .
Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago .
Since then , the combination of Earth 's distance from the Sun , physical properties , and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive .
In the history of the Earth , biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion , occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events .
Over 99 % of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct .
Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely ; most species have not been described .
Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival .
Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures ; politically , the world has about 200 sovereign states .
