An all-seater stadium is a sports stadium in which every spectator has a seat .
This is commonplace in association football stadiums in nations such as the United Kingdom , Spain , and the Netherlands .
Most association football -LRB- soccer -RRB- , American football stadiums in the United States and Canadian Football League stadiums in Canada are all-seaters , as are most baseball and track and field stadiums in those countries .
A stadium that is not an all-seater has areas for attendees holding standing-room only tickets to stand and view the proceedings .
Such standing areas were known as terraces in Britain .
Stands with only terraces used to dominate the football attendance in the UK .
For instance , the South Bank Stand behind the southern goal at Molineux Stadium , Wolverhampton , home of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. , had a maximum of 32,000 standing attenders , while the rest of the stadium hosted a little bit less than that -LRB- total maximum attendance was around 59,000 -RRB- .
Some European countries , such as Germany , do not have all-seater stadiums .
German fans expressed a preference to stand while watching football , so the country 's grounds have large terraced areas .
For instance , Borussia Dortmund 's Westfalenstadion -LRB- commercially known as Signal Iduna Park -RRB- has an all-seated capacity of 65,829 , but during Bundesliga games the attendance limit is set to 81,360 .
-LRB- If the general rule `` two standing occupies the same space as one sitting '' applies , then around 15,000 seats are replaced by 30,000 standing attenders at Bundesliga games . -RRB-
