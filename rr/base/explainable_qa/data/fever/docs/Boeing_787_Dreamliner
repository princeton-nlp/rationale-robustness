The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American long-haul , mid-size widebody , twin-engine jet airliner made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes .
Its variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical three-class seating configurations .
It is a pioneering airliner with the use of composite materials as the primary material in the construction of its airframe .
The 787 was designed to be 20 % more fuel efficient than the Boeing 767 , which it was intended to replace .
The 787 Dreamliner 's distinguishing features include mostly electrical flight systems , raked wingtips , and noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles .
It shares a common type rating with the larger Boeing 777 to allow qualified pilots to operate both models .
The aircraft 's initial designation was the 7E7 , prior to its renaming in January 2005 .
The first 787 was unveiled in a roll-out ceremony on July 8 , 2007 at Boeing 's Everett factory .
Development and production of the 787 has involved a large-scale collaboration with numerous suppliers worldwide .
Final assembly takes place at the Boeing Everett Factory in Everett , Washington , and at the Boeing South Carolina factory in North Charleston , South Carolina .
Originally planned to enter service in May 2008 , the project experienced multiple delays .
The airliner 's maiden flight took place on December 15 , 2009 , and completed flight testing in mid-2011 .
Boeing has reportedly spent $ 32 billion on the 787 program .
Final US Federal Aviation Administration -LRB- FAA -RRB- and European Aviation Safety Agency -LRB- EASA -RRB- type certification was received in August 2011 and the first 787-8 was delivered in September 2011 .
It entered commercial service on October 26 , 2011 with launch customer All Nippon Airways .
The stretched 787-9 variant , which is 20 ft longer and can fly 450 nmi farther than the -8 , first flew in September 2013 .
Deliveries of the 787-9 began in July 2014 ; it entered commercial service on August 7 , 2014 with All Nippon Airways , with 787-9 launch customer Air New Zealand following two days later .
As of April 2017 , the 787 had orders for 1,213 aircraft from 64 customers , with All Nippon Airways having the largest number on order .
The aircraft has suffered from several in-service problems , including fires on board related to its lithium-ion batteries .
These systems were reviewed by both the FAA and the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau .
The FAA issued a directive in January 2013 that grounded all 787s in the US and other civil aviation authorities followed suit .
After Boeing completed tests on a revised battery design , the FAA approved the revised design and lifted the grounding in April 2013 ; the 787 returned to passenger service later that month .
