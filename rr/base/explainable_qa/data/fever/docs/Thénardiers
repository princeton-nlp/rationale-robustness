The Thénardiers , commonly known as Monsieur Thénardier -LRB- -LSB- təˈnɑrdi.eɪ -RSB- -LSB- tenaʁdje -RSB- -RRB- and Madame Thénardier , are fictional characters , the secondary antagonists in Victor Hugo 's 1862 novel Les Misérables and in many adaptations of the novel into other media .
They are ordinary working-class people who blame society for their sufferings .
Early in the novel , they own an inn and cheat their customers .
After they lose the inn in bankruptcy , they change their name to `` Jondrette '' and live by begging and petty thievery .
They serve , alongside Javert , as one of the two arch-nemeses of the story 's protagonist , Jean Valjean .
While Javert represents the justice system that would punish Valjean , the Thenardiers represent the lawless subculture of society that would blackmail him .
The novel portrays them as brutal and abusive figures ; some adaptations transform them into clownish characters , though sometimes still criminals , to provide comic relief from the generally more serious tone of the story .
