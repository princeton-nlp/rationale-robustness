Jeffrey Katzenberg had frequently suggested an animated adaptation of the 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company , and he decided to put the idea into production after founding DreamWorks in 1995 .
To make this inaugural project , DreamWorks employed artists who had worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation and the recently disbanded Amblimation , totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different nations .
The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery , created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics .
Theatrically released on December 18 , 1998 , and on home video on September 14 , 1999 , reviews were generally positive , with critics praising the animation , music , and voice work .
The film went on to gross over $ 218 million worldwide in theaters , which made it the most successful non-Disney animated feature at the time .
The film 's success led to the direct-to-video prequel Joseph : King of Dreams -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and the development of a stage adaptation .
The song `` When You Believe '' became a commercially successful single in a pop version performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey , and went on to win Best Original Song at the 1999 Academy Awards .
