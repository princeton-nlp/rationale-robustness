An Olympic medal is awarded to successful competitors at one of the Olympic Games .
There are three classes of medal : gold , awarded to the winner ; silver , awarded to the 1st runner-up ; and bronze , awarded to the second runner-up .
The granting of awards is laid out in detail in the Olympic protocols .
Medal designs have varied considerably since the first Olympic Games in 1896 , particularly in size and weight .
A standard obverse -LRB- front -RRB- design of the medals for the Summer Olympic Games began in 1928 and remained for many years , until its replacement at the 2004 Games as the result of controversy surrounding the use of the Roman Colosseum rather than a building representing the Games ' Greek roots .
The medals of the Winter Olympic Games never had a common design , but regularly feature snowflakes .
In addition to generally supporting their Olympic athletes , some countries provide sums of money and gifts to medal winners , depending on the classes and number of medals won .
