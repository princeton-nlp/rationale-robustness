`` The dress '' is a photo that became a viral Internet picture on 26 February 2015 , when viewers disagreed over whether the item of clothing depicted was black and blue or white and gold .
The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception which have been the subject of ongoing scientific investigation in neuroscience and vision science , with a number of papers published in peer-reviewed science journals .
The photo originated from a washed-out colour photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr , and a dispute over whether the dress pictured was blue and black , or white and gold .
In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone , more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress , using hashtags such as #thedress , #whiteandgold and #blackandblue .
Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue , the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms , with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour .
At the same time , members of the scientific community began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision .
The dress itself , which was identified as a product of the retailer Roman Originals , experienced a major surge in sales as a result of the incident .
The retailer also produced a one-off version of the dress actually coloured in white and gold as a charity campaign .
