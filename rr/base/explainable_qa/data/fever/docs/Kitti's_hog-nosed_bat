Kitti 's hog-nosed bat -LRB- Craseonycteris thonglongyai -RRB- , also known as the bumblebee bat , is a vulnerable species of bat and the only extant member of the family Craseonycteridae .
It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma , where it occupies limestone caves along rivers .
Kitti 's hog-nosed bat is the smallest species of bat and arguably the world 's smallest mammal .
It has a reddish-brown or grey coat , with a distinctive pig-like snout .
Colonies range greatly in size , with an average of 100 individuals per cave .
The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn , foraging around nearby forest areas for insects .
Females give birth annually to a single offspring .
Although the bat 's status in Burma is not well known , the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk for extinction .
Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic , and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites .
