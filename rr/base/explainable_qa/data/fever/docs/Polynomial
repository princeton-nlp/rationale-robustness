In mathematics , a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables -LRB- or indeterminates -RRB- and coefficients , that involves only the operations of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and non-negative integer exponents .
An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is .
An example in three variables is .
Polynomials appear in a wide variety of areas of mathematics and science .
For example , they are used to form polynomial equations , which encode a wide range of problems , from elementary word problems to complicated problems in the sciences ; they are used to define polynomial functions , which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science ; they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions .
In advanced mathematics , polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties , central concepts in algebra and algebraic geometry .
