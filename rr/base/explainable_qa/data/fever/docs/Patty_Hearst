Patricia Campbell `` Patty '' Hearst -LRB- born February 20 , 1954 -RRB- , now known as Patricia Hearst Shaw , is the granddaughter of American publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst .
She became nationally known for events following her 1974 kidnapping while she was a 19-year-old student living in Berkeley , California .
Hearst was abducted by a left-wing terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army .
After being isolated and threatened with death , she became supportive of their cause , making propaganda announcements for them and taking part in illegal activities .
Hearst was found 19 months after her kidnapping , by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes .
She was held in custody , despite speculation that her family 's resources would prevent her spending time in jail .
At her trial , the prosecution suggested that she had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition , and that sexual activities between her and SLA members had not amounted to rape .
She was found guilty of bank robbery .
Hearst 's sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter , and she was pardoned by President Bill Clinton .
