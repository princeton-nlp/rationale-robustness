Set in Western Canada , Until Dawn centers around a group of eight teenagers who decide to vacation for a night in a cabin on the fictional Blackwood Mountain , exactly one year after the disappearance of two girls , the twin sisters of a member of their group .
Shortly after arriving , the gang find themselves under attack by a psychopath , and must attempt to survive until sunrise .
Throughout the adventure , players alternate between all eight characters , making critical decisions as the story advances which drastically affects the game 's outcome , leading to hundreds of different scenarios .
Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release , with praise directed at the visuals , ` choice ' mechanic , horror elements , music , characters , voice acting , and gameplay design .
Most of the criticism the game drew concerned the second half of the story , the camera angles , character movement , and the game 's partially linear plot .
