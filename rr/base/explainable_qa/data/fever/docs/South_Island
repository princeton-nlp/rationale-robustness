The South Island or Te Waipounamu -LRB- Māori -RRB- is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand , the other being the smaller but more populous North Island .
It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait , to the west by the Tasman Sea , and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean .
The South Island covers 150437 km2 and has a temperate climate .
It has a 32 percent larger landmass than the North Island so is sometimes referred to as the `` mainland '' of New Zealand , especially by South Island residents , but only 23 percent of New Zealand 's million inhabitants live there .

The North Island population overtook the South in the early 20th century , with 56 percent of the population living in the North in 1911 , and the drift north of people and businesses continued throughout the century .
