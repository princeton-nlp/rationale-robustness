Henry II -LRB- Henri II 31 March 1519 -- 10 July 1559 -RRB- was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 31 March 1547 until his death in 1559 .
The second son of Francis I , he became Dauphin of France upon the death of his elder brother Francis III , Duke of Brittany , in 1536 .
As a child , Henry and his elder brother spent over four years in captivity in Spain as hostages in exchange for their father .
Henry pursued his father 's policies in matter of arts , wars and religion .
He persevered in the Italian Wars against the House of Habsburg and tried to suppress the Protestant Reformation , even as the Huguenot numbers were increasing drastically in France during his reign .
The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis -LRB- 1559 -RRB- , which put an end to the Italian Wars , had mixed results : France renounced its claims to territories in Italy , but gained certain other territories , including the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics .
France failed to change the balance of power in Europe , as Spain remained the sole dominant power , but it did benefit from the division of the holdings of its ruler , Charles V , and from the weakening of the Holy Roman Empire , which Charles also ruled .
Henry suffered an untimely death in a jousting tournament held to celebrate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis at the conclusion of the Eighth Italian War .
The king 's surgeon , Ambroise Paré , was unable to cure the infected wound inflicted by Gabriel de Montgomery , the captain of his Scottish Guard .
He was succeeded in turn by three of his sons , whose ineffective reigns helped to spark the French Wars of Religion between Protestants and Catholics .
