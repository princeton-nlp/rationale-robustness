Extracorporeal shockwave therapy -LRB- ESWT -RRB- is a treatment used in physical therapy , orthopedics , urology and cardiology .
The shock waves are abrupt , high amplitude pulses of mechanical energy , similar to soundwaves , generated by an electromagnetic coil or a spark in water .
Similar technology using focused higher energies is used to break up kidney and gallstones , and is termed lithotripsy .
`` Extracorporeal '' means that the shockwaves are generated externally to the body and transmitted from a pad through the skin .
