The Times is a British daily -LRB- Monday to Saturday -RRB- national newspaper based in London , England .
It began in 1785 under the title , adopting its current name on 1 January 1788 .
The Times and its sister paper The Sunday Times -LRB- founded in 1821 -RRB- are published by Times Newspapers , since 1981 a subsidiary of News UK , itself wholly owned by News Corp. .
The Times and The Sunday Times do not share editorial staff , were founded independently and have only had common ownership since 1967 .
In 1959 the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of The Times in shaping the views of events of London 's elite :
For much more than a century The Times has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain .
Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated , and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility .
While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns , its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain .
To guide this treatment , the editors have for long periods been in close touch with 10 Downing Street .
The Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name , lending it to numerous other papers around the world , including The Times of India -LRB- founded in 1838 -RRB- , The Straits Times -LRB- Singapore -RRB- -LRB- 1845 -RRB- , The New York Times -LRB- 1851 -RRB- , The Irish Times -LRB- 1859 -RRB- , Le Temps -LRB- France -RRB- -LRB- 1861-1942 -RRB- , the Cape Times -LRB- South Africa -RRB- -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , the Los Angeles Times -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , the Trenton Times -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , The Seattle Times -LRB- 1891 -RRB- , The Manila Times -LRB- 1898 -RRB- , The Daily Times -LRB- Malawi -RRB- -LRB- 1900 -RRB- , El Tiempo -LRB- Colombia -RRB- -LRB- 1911 -RRB- , The Canberra Times -LRB- 1926 -RRB- , Times of Malta -LRB- 1935 -RRB- , and The Washington Times -LRB- 1982 -RRB- .
In these countries , the newspaper is often referred to as or , although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution .
The Times is the originator of the widely used Times Roman typeface , originally developed by Stanley Morison of The Times in collaboration with the Monotype Corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing .
In November 2006 The Times began printing headlines in a new font , Times Modern .
The Times was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years , but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport .
The Sunday Times remains a broadsheet .
