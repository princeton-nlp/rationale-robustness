Bus Stop is a 1956 American romantic comedy film directed by Joshua Logan for 20th Century Fox , starring Marilyn Monroe , Don Murray , Arthur O'Connell , Betty Field , Eileen Heckart , Robert Bray and Hope Lange .
Unlike most of Monroe 's movies , Bus Stop is neither a full-fledged comedy nor a musical , but rather a dramatic piece ; it was the first film she appeared in after studying at the Actors Studio in New York .
Monroe does however sing one song : `` That Old Black Magic '' by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer .
Bus Stop was based on two plays by William Inge , People in the Wind and Bus Stop .
The inspiration for the play Bus Stop came from people Inge met in Tonganoxie , Kansas .
In the 1961 -- 62 season , ABC adapted the play and film into a television series of the same name , Bus Stop starring Marilyn Maxwell as the owner of the bus station and diner .
In the segment `` Ch√©rie '' which most closely follows the film , Tuesday Weld performed the role of Marilyn Monroe , and Gary Lockwood appeared as the Don Murray character .
The film was shot in Idaho and Arizona .
