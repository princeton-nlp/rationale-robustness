The Airbus A380 is a double-deck , wide-body , four-engine jet airliner manufactured by European manufacturer Airbus .
It is the world 's largest passenger airliner , and the airports at which it operates have upgraded facilities to accommodate it .
It was initially named Airbus A3XX and designed to challenge Boeing 's monopoly in the large-aircraft market .
The A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service on 25 October 2007 with Singapore Airlines .
