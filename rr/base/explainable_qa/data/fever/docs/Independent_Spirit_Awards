The Film Independent Spirit Awards -LRB- abbreviated `` Spirit Awards '' and originally known as the FINDIE or Friends of Independents Awards -RRB- , founded in 1984 , are awards dedicated to independent filmmakers .
Winners were typically presented with acrylic glass pyramids containing suspended shoestrings representing the paltry budgets of independent films .
In 1986 , the event was renamed the Independent Spirit Awards .
Since 2006 , winners have received a trophy depicting a bird with its wings spread sitting atop of a pole with the shoestrings from the previous design wrapped around the pole .
Now called the Film Independent Spirit Awards , the show is produced by Film Independent , the non-profit arts organization whose mission is to champion creative independence in visual storytelling and support a community of artists who embody diversity , innovation and uniqueness of vision .
Film Independent Members vote to determine the winners of the Spirit Awards .
The awards show is held inside a tent on the beach in Santa Monica , California , usually on the day before the Academy Awards -LRB- since 1999 ; originally the Saturday before -RRB- .
The show is broadcast live on the IFC network , as well as Hollywood Suite in Canada and A&E Latin America .
The 32nd Independent Spirit Awards ceremony , hosted by Nick Kroll and John Mulaney , was broadcast live on IFC on Saturday , February 25 at 2p/5e with an on-demand version available on Sundance Now .
