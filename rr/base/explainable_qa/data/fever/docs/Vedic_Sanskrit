Vedic Sanskrit is an Indo-European language , more specifically one branch of the Indo-Iranian group .
It is the ancient language of the Vedas of Hinduism , texts compiled over the period of the mid-2nd to mid-1st millennium BCE .
It was orally preserved , predating the advent of Brahmi script by several centuries .
Vedic Sanskrit is an archaic language , whose consensus translation has been challenging .
Extensive ancient literature in the Vedic Sanskrit language has survived into the modern era , and this has been a major source of information about Indo-European parent language .
Quite early in the pre-historic era , Sanskrit separated from the Avestan language -LRB- an Eastern Iranian language -RRB- .
The exact century of separation is unknown but this separation of Sanskrit and Avestan occurred certainly before 1800 BCE .
Avestan language developed in ancient Persia , was the language of Zoroastrianism , but was a dead language in the Sasanian period .
Vedic Sanskrit developed independently in ancient India , evolved into classical Sanskrit after the grammar and linguistic treatise of Pāṇini , and later into many related Indian subcontinent languages in which are found the voluminous ancient and medieval literature of Buddhism , Hinduism and Jainism .
