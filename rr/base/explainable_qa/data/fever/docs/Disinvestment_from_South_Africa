Disinvestment -LRB- or divestment -RRB- from South Africa was first advocated in the 1960s , in protest of South Africa 's system of apartheid , but was not implemented on a significant scale until the mid-1980s .
The disinvestment campaign , after being realized in federal legislation enacted in 1986 by the United States , is credited by some as pressuring the South African Government to embark on negotiations ultimately leading to the dismantling of the Apartheid system .
