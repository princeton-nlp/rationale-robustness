Jane Eyre -LSB- ˈɛər -RSB- -LRB- originally published as Jane Eyre : An Autobiography -RRB- is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë .
It was published on 16 October 1847 , by Smith , Elder & Co. of London , England , under the pen name `` Currer Bell '' .
The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York .
Primarily of the Bildungsroman genre , Jane Eyre follows the emotions and experiences of its eponymous heroine , including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester , the Byronic master of fictitious Thornfield Hall .
In its internalisation of the action -- the focus is on the gradual unfolding of Jane 's moral and spiritual sensibility , and all the events are coloured by a heightened intensity that was previously the domain of poetry -- Jane Eyre revolutionised the art of fiction .
Charlotte Brontë has been called the ` first historian of the private consciousness ' and the literary ancestor of writers like Joyce and Proust .
The novel contains elements of social criticism , with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core , but is nonetheless a novel many consider ahead of its time given the individualistic character of Jane and the novel 's exploration of classism , sexuality , religion , and proto-feminism .
