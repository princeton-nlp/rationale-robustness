Linux -LRB- pronounced -LSB- - en audio = Linus-linux .
oggˈlɪnəks -RSB- or , less frequently , -LSB- ˈlaɪnəks -RSB- -RRB- is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution .
The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel , an operating system kernel first released on September 17 , 1991 by Linus Torvalds .
The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to describe the operating system , which has led to some controversy .
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture , but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system .
Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones , Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems .
Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and is used on 99.6 % of the TOP500 supercomputers .
It is used by around 2.3 % of desktop computers .
The Chromebook , which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS , dominates the US K -- 12 education market and represents nearly 20 % of the sub - $ 300 notebook sales in the US .
Linux also runs on embedded systems -- devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system .
This includes TiVo and similar DVR devices , network routers , facility automation controls , televisions , video game consoles and smartwatches .
Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives .
The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration .
The underlying source code may be used , modified and distributedcommercially or non-commerciallyby anyone under the terms of its respective licenses , such as the GNU General Public License .
Typically , Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution -LRB- or distro for short -RRB- for both desktop and server use .
Some of the most popular mainstream Linux distributions are Arch Linux , CentOS , Debian , Fedora , Gentoo Linux , Linux Mint , Mageia , openSUSE and Ubuntu , together with commercial distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server .
Distributions include the Linux kernel , supporting utilities and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project , and usually a large amount of application software to fulfil the distribution 's intended use .
Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system , such as X11 , Mir or a Wayland implementation , and an accompanying desktop environment such as GNOME or the KDE Software Compilation ; some distributions may also include a less resource-intensive desktop , such as LXDE or Xfce .
Distributions intended to run on servers may omit all graphical environments from the standard install , and instead include other software to set up and operate a solution stack such as LAMP .
Because Linux is freely redistributable , anyone may create a distribution for any intended use .
