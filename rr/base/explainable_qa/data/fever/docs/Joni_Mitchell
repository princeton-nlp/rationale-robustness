Roberta Joan `` Joni '' Mitchell , CC -LRB- n√©e Anderson ; born November 7 , 1943 -RRB- is a Canadian singer-songwriter and painter .
Rolling Stone called her `` one of the greatest songwriters ever '' , and AllMusic has stated , `` When the dust settles , Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century '' .
Drawing from folk , pop , rock and jazz , Mitchell 's songs often reflect social and environmental ideals as well as her feelings about romance , confusion , disillusionment and joy .
Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan and western Canada before busking in the streets and shoddy nightclubs of Toronto .
In 1965 , she moved to the United States and began touring .
Some of her original songs -LRB- `` Urge for Going '' , `` Chelsea Morning '' , `` Both Sides , Now '' , `` The Circle Game '' -RRB- were covered by folk singers , allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album in 1968 .
Settling in Southern California , Mitchell , with popular songs like `` Big Yellow Taxi '' and `` Woodstock '' , helped define an era and a generation .
Her 1971 recording Blue was rated the 30th best album ever made in Rolling Stone 's list of the `` 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' , the highest entry by a female artist .
Mitchell switched labels and began moving toward jazz rhythms by way of lush pop textures on 1974 's Court and Spark , her best-selling LP , featuring the radio hits `` Help Me '' and `` Free Man in Paris '' .
Around 1975 her vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto .
Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz , melding it with influences of rock and roll , R&B , classical music , and non-western beats .
In the late 1970s , she began working closely with noted jazz musicians , among them Jaco Pastorius , Wayne Shorter , Herbie Hancock , Pat Metheny , and Charles Mingus , who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings .
She turned again toward pop , embraced electronic music , and engaged in political protest .
She is the sole producer credited on most of her albums , including all her work in the 1970s .
A blunt critic of the music industry , she quit touring and released her 17th , and reportedly last , album of original songs in 2007 .
With roots in visual art , Mitchell designed her own album covers .
She describes herself as a `` painter derailed by circumstance '' .
