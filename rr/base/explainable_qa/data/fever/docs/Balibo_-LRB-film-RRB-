Balibo is a 2009 Australian war film that follows the story of the Balibo Five , a group of journalists who were captured and killed while reporting on activities just prior to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor of 1975 .
While historically accurate , the film is loosely based on the book Cover-Up by Jill Jolliffe , an Australian journalist who met the men before they were killed .
The film follows dishevelled journalist Roger East , played by Anthony LaPaglia , who travels to East Timor in 1975 to investigate the deaths of the Balibo Five during the buildup to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor .
Oscar Isaac plays the young Jos√© Ramos-Horta , who would later receive the Nobel Peace Prize and become the second President of East Timor , who joins East in the movie .
Filming began on 30 June 2008 , in Dili , East Timor , and the film was released the following year .
It was produced by Arenafilm in Australia with Robert Connolly as director , David Williamson as screenwriter , and Professor Clinton Fernandes as historical consultant .
LaPaglia , also an Executive Producer , named East as `` probably the best role I 've ever had '' .
