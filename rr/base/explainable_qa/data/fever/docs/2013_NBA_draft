The 2013 NBA draft was held on June 27 , 2013 , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York .
National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players , including international players .
The lottery took place on May 21 , 2013 .
This was the first draft for New Orleans under their new Pelicans name after playing as the New Orleans Hornets previously .
It would also be the last draft for the Charlotte Bobcats under their old name , as they went back to playing under their old Hornets moniker that they last used in 2002 once the 2013 -- 14 NBA season was over .
Highlights of the draft included the first Canadian number one selection -LRB- Anthony Bennett -RRB- , who is now widely considered to be one of the biggest draft busts in league history due to his lack of output within his first few seasons .
The selection of Anthony Bennett very much surprised Bill Simmons , who was an analyst at the draft , as he yelled `` whoa '' on national television immediately after David Stern announced the selection .
The draft also included the first Canadian pair of lottery picks -LRB- Bennett and Kelly Olynyk -RRB- , the first Iranian draft choice -LRB- Arsalan Kazemi -RRB- , the first New Zealander first round pick -LRB- Steven Adams -RRB- and the last first round draft selections announced by then-NBA commissioner David Stern , the very last of which included a visit by Hakeem Olajuwon , Stern 's first pick he ever announced back in 1984 .
He was replaced by current commissioner Adam Silver beginning with the 2014 NBA draft .
