The 19th G7 Summit was held in Tokyo , Japan , on July 7 -- 9 , 1993 .
The venue for the summit meetings was the State Guesthouse in Tokyo , Japan .
The Group of Seven -LRB- G7 -RRB- was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries : France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada -LRB- since 1976 -RRB- and the President of the European Commission -LRB- starting officially in 1981 -RRB- .
The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions ; and in fact , a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France 's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany 's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the first Group of Six -LRB- G6 -RRB- summit in 1975 .
