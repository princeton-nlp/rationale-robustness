SummerSlam -LRB- 2015 -RRB- was a professional wrestling pay-per-view -LRB- PPV -RRB- event produced by WWE .
It took place on August 23 , 2015 , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , New York .
The twenty-eighth event under the SummerSlam chronology , this was the first since 2008 to be held outside of Los Angeles as Staples Center was the exclusive home for SummerSlam from 2009 to 2014 , and the eighth SummerSlam to be held in the New York metropolitan area .
The Izod Center was originally supposed to host SummerSlam , but due to its closure in April 2015 , the event was moved to Barclays Center .
The event was the first in the SummerSlam chronology to be four hours in length , a length previously reserved only for WrestleMania .
The event was the second night of what was billed as a `` triple-header '' at Barclays Center , with NXT TakeOver : Brooklyn having taken place the previous night , and Raw the following night .
Ten matches were contested at the event , with no pre-show .
In the main event , The Undertaker defeated Brock Lesnar in controversial fashion ; Lesnar put Undertaker in his Kimura lock and the timekeeper rang the bell after seeing the Undertaker supposedly indicating submission , but since the referee had n't seen a submission and never stopped the match , the match continued .
The confusion allowed Undertaker to surprise Lesnar with a low blow before trapping him in the Hell 's Gate submission hold , during which Lesnar passed out to give Undertaker the win .
