The Bloods are a primarily , though not exclusively , African American street gang founded in Los Angeles , California .
The gang is widely known for its rivalry with the Crips .
They are identified by the red color worn by their members and by particular gang symbols , including distinctive hand signs .
The Bloods comprise various sub-groups known as `` sets '' between which significant differences exist such as colors , clothing , and operations , and political ideas which may be in open conflict with each other .
Since their creation , the Bloods gangs have branched out throughout the United States .
