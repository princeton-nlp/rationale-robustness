Peter Edward `` Ginger '' Baker -LRB- born 19 August 1939 -RRB- is an English drummer , best known as the founder of the rock band Cream .
Baker 's work in the 1960s earned him praise as `` rock 's first superstar drummer '' , although his individual style melded a jazz background with his interest in African rhythms .
Baker is an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cream and is widely considered one of the most influential drummers of all time , recognised by his induction into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2008 , and his induction into the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2016 .
Baker is credited as a pioneer of drumming in genres like jazz fusion , heavy metal and world music .
Baker began playing drums at age 15 around 1954 , and later took lessons from Phil Seamen .
In the 1960s , he joined Blues Incorporated , where he met bassist Jack Bruce .
The two clashed often , but would be rhythm section partners again in the Graham Bond Organisation and Cream , the latter of which Baker co-founded with Eric Clapton in 1966 .
Cream achieved worldwide success but only lasted until 1968 , in part due to Baker 's and Bruce 's volatile relationship .
After briefly working with Clapton in Blind Faith and leading Ginger Baker 's Air Force , Baker spent several years in the 1970s living and recording in Africa , often with Fela Kuti , in pursuit of his long-time interest in African music .
Among Baker 's other collaborations are his work with Gary Moore , Masters of Reality , Public Image Ltd , Atomic Rooster , Bill Laswell , jazz bassist Charlie Haden , jazz guitarist Bill Frisell , and another personally led effort , Ginger Baker 's Energy .
Baker 's drumming attracted attention for his style , showmanship , and use of two bass drums instead of the conventional one .
In his early days , he performed lengthy drum solos , most notably in the Cream song `` Toad '' , one of the earliest recorded examples in rock music .
