Trick-or-treating is a Halloween custom for children in many countries .
Children in costumes travel from house to house asking for treats such as candy -LRB- or , in some cultures , money -RRB- with the phrase `` Trick or treat '' .
The `` trick '' is a -LRB- usually idle -RRB- threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given to them .
It typically happens during the evening of October 31 .
Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats , for example by putting up Halloween decorations outside their door .
Others might simply leave treats on their porch .
In North America , trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition since the late 1920s .
In Britain and Ireland the tradition of going house-to-house collecting food at Halloween goes back at least as far as the 16th century , as had the tradition of people wearing costumes at Halloween .
In 19th century Britain and Ireland , there are many accounts of people going house-to-house in costume at Halloween , reciting verses in exchange for food , and sometimes warning of misfortune if they were not welcomed .
The Scottish Halloween custom of `` guising '' -- children disguised in costume going from house to house for food or money -- is first recorded in North America in 1911 .
While going house-to-house in costume has remained popular among Scots and Irish , the custom of saying `` trick or treat '' has only recently become common .
The activity is prevalent in the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , Puerto Rico , and northwestern and central Mexico .
In the latter , this practice is called calaverita -LRB- Spanish for `` little skull '' -RRB- , and instead of `` trick or treat '' , the children ask Â¿ me da mi calaverita ?
-LRB- `` can you give me my little skull ? '' -RRB-
where a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate .
