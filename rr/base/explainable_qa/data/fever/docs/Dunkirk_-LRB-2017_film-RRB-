Dunkirk is an upcoming English-language war film written , co-produced , and directed by Christopher Nolan .
Set during World War II , it concerns the Dunkirk evacuation .
The film is a co-production between the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , France , and the United States .
Nolan wrote the story with the intention to tell it from three perspectives -- the air , land and sea .
Efforts were made to create suspense solely through details , as the script contained little dialogue .

Dunkirk is scheduled to be released on 21 July 2017 in IMAX .
