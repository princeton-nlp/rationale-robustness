Tenacious D is the first studio album by American comedy rock band Tenacious D , released on September 25 , 2001 by Epic Records .
The album 's polished production was a departure from the band 's acoustic origins , due in part to the production of the Dust Brothers .
`` Tribute '' was the first single released from the album , followed by `` Wonderboy '' .
Both singles had music videos filmed for them , with the Liam Lynch -- directed Tribute video achieving cult status .
While Tenacious D did not achieve chart success after its release , it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America by the end of 2005 .
Despite only peaking at # 38 in the UK , it had sold 426,000 copies countrywide by 2006 .
