The Cincinnati Kid is a 1965 American drama film .
It tells the story of Eric `` The Kid '' Stoner , a young Depression-era poker player , as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best .
This quest leads him to challenge Lancey `` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two .
The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten .
The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard .
Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his `` ugly duckling '' film .
He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects .
The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances .
