De Profundis -LRB- Latin : `` from the depths '' -RRB- is a letter written by Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment in Reading Gaol , to `` Bosie '' -LRB- Lord Alfred Douglas -RRB- .
In its first half Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde 's conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency .
He indicts both Lord Alfred 's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes .
In the second half , Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ , whom he characterises as a romantic , individualist artist .
The letter began `` Dear Bosie '' and ended `` Your Affectionate Friend '' .
Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897 , close to the end of his imprisonment .
Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision , physical labour and emotional isolation .
Nelson , the new prison governor , thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour .
He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write `` for medicinal purposes '' ; each page was taken away when completed , and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions .
Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897 .
Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross -LRB- another former lover , loyal friend and rival to `` Bosie '' -RRB- .
Ross published the letter in 1905 , five years after Wilde 's death , giving it the title `` De Profundis '' from Psalm 130 .
It was an incomplete version , excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family ; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde 's letters .
