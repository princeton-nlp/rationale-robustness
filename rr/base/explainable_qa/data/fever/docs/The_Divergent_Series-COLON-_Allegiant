Allegiant was released on March 18 , 2016 , in theaters and IMAX and received mainly negative reviews .
The film was a financial disappointment , grossing $ 179 million worldwide , becoming the lowest-grossing Divergent film .
This led to budget cuts on the fourth and the possibility that the final installment in the series , Ascendant , would be released as a TV movie instead of a theatrical one .
