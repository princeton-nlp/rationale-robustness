Dwight Kurt Schrute III -LSB- ˈdwait ˈkərt ˈshrut -RSB- is a fictional character on the American TV comedy series The Office , portrayed by Rainn Wilson , and based on Gareth Keenan from the original UK version of The Office .
His character is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant to the regional manager at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin , although the series expands on his character as bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms , a beet plantation , and as the owner of the business park enclosing Dunder Mifflin .
He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense , his love for martial arts and the justice system , and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert .
He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch , but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant -LRB- to the -RRB- Regional Manager .
In the final season , Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager .
