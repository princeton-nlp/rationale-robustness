Hollow Man is a 2000 American-German science fiction horror film directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon , Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin .
Bacon portrays the title character , a scientist who renders himself invisible and goes on a killing spree , a story inspired by H. G. Wells ' novel The Invisible Man .
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Visual Effects in 2001 , but lost to Gladiator .
The film is Verhoeven 's most recent American production .
In 2013 , Verhoeven remarked to The Hollywood Reporter : `` I decided after Hollow Man , this is a movie , the first movie that I made that I thought I should not have made .
It made money and this and that , but it really is not me anymore .
I think many other people could have done that .
I do n't think many people could have made RoboCop that way , or either Starship Troopers .
But Hollow Man , I thought there might have been 20 directors in Hollywood who could have done that .
I felt depressed with myself after 2002 . ''
It partly contributed in his return to the Netherlands , his home country , where he made Black Book in 2006 , which was considered a return to form .
A direct-to-video stand-alone sequel called Hollow Man 2 starring Christian Slater and Peter Facinelli was released in 2006 .
