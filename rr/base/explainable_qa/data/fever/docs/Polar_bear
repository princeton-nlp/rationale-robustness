The polar bear -LRB- ursus #Latin maritimus #Latin -RRB- is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle , encompassing the Arctic Ocean , its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses .
It is a large bear , approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear -LRB- Ursus arctos middendorffi -RRB- .
A boar -LRB- adult male -RRB- weighs around 350 -- , while a sow -LRB- adult female -RRB- is about half that size .
Although it is the sister species of the brown bear , it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures , for moving across snow , ice and open water , and for hunting seals , which make up most of its diet .
Although most polar bears are born on land , they spend most of their time on the sea ice .
Their scientific name means `` maritime bear '' and derives from this fact .
Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice , often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present .
Because of their dependence on the sea ice , polar bears are classified as marine mammals ; an alternative basis for classification as marine mammals is that they depend on the ocean as their main food source .
Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change , the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species , and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline .
For decades , large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species , but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect .
For thousands of years , the polar bear has been a key figure in the material , spiritual , and cultural life of circumpolar peoples , and polar bears remain important in their cultures .
