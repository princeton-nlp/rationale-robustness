Streptococcus is a genus of coccus -LRB- spherical -RRB- Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes and the order Lactobacillales -LRB- lactic acid bacteria -RRB- .
Cell division in this genus occurs along a single axis in these bacteria , thus they grow in chains or pairs , hence the name -- from Greek στρεπτός streptos , meaning easily bent or twisted , like a chain -LRB- twisted chain -RRB- .
-LRB- Contrast this with staphylococci , which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells . -RRB-
Most are oxidase-negative and catalase-negative , and many are facultative anaerobes .
In 1984 , many bacteria formerly considered Streptococcus were separated out into the genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus .
Currently , over 50 species are recognised in this genus .
This genus has been found to be part of the salivary microbiome .
