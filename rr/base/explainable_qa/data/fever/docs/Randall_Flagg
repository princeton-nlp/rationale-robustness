Randall Flagg is a fictional character created by Stephen King .
He has a variety of names , usually with the initial letters `` R. F. '' but with occasional exceptions , such as Walter o'Dim -LRB- originally envisioned by King as a separate character -RRB- in The Dark Tower series .
Flagg is described as `` an accomplished sorcerer and a devoted servant of the Outer Dark '' , with supernatural abilities involving necromancy , prophecy , and influence over animal and human behavior .
His goals typically center on bringing down civilizations through destruction and conflict .
Flagg has appeared in at least nine of King 's novels , either as a major or very minor character .
Flagg first appeared in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population .
He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos .
Flagg was a primary antagonist in King 's epic series , The Dark Tower , who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower -LRB- the linchpin of existence -RRB- so he can claim it for himself and become a god .
The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg 's background and motivation , linking his previous appearances .
Aside from King 's novels , Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand -LRB- played by Jamey Sheridan -RRB- and the upcoming Dark Tower film adaptation -LRB- played by Matthew McConaughey -RRB- .
He has also appeared in Marvel Comics ' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand .
King initially cited Donald DeFreeze , primary kidnapper of Patty Hearst , as his inspiration for Flagg .
Later , he attributed Flagg to an image of a man walking the roads in cowboy boots , denim jeans , and a jacket , a notion which `` came out of nowhere '' when he was in college .
Flagg 's character and the nature of his evil have been the subject of considerable critical attention .
