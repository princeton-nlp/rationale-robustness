A quarry is a place from which dimension stone , rock , construction aggregate , riprap , sand , gravel , or slate has been excavated from the ground .
A quarry is the same thing as an open-pit mine from which minerals are extracted .
The only non-trivial difference between the two is that open-pit mines that produce building materials and dimension stone are commonly referred to as quarries .
The word quarry can also include the underground quarrying for stone , such as Bath stone .
