Keturah was a concubine and wife of the Biblical patriarch Abraham .
According to the Book of Genesis , Abraham married Keturah after the death of his first wife , Sarah ; Abraham and Keturah had six sons .
One modern commentator on the Hebrew Bible has called Keturah `` the most ignored significant person in the Torah '' .
Some Jewish scholars have believed Keturah to be the same person as Abraham 's concubine Hagar , but this view is not universally held .
