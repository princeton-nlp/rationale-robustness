Stanley Park is a 1001 acre public park that borders the downtown of Vancouver in British Columbia , Canada and is almost entirely surrounded by waters of Vancouver Harbour and English Bay .
The park has a long history and was one of the first areas to be explored in the city .
The land was originally used by indigenous peoples for thousands of years before British Columbia was colonized by the British during the 1858 Fraser Canyon Gold Rush .
For many years after colonization , the future park with its abundant resources would also be home to nonaboriginal settlers .
The land was later turned into Vancouver 's first park when the city incorporated in 1886 .
It was named after Lord Stanley , 16th Earl of Derby , a British politician who had recently been appointed governor general .
Unlike other large urban parks , Stanley Park is not the creation of a landscape architect , but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years .
Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S. Rawlings .
Additional attractions , such as a polar bear exhibit , aquarium , and miniature train , were added in the post-war period .
Much of the park remains as densely forested as it was in the late 1800s , with about a half million trees , some of which stand as tall as 76 m and are up to hundreds of years old .
Thousands of trees were lost -LRB- and many replanted -RRB- after three major windstorms that took place in the past 100 years , the last in 2006 .
Significant effort was put into constructing the near-century-old Vancouver Seawall , which can draw thousands of residents and visitors to the park every day .
The park also features forest trails , beaches , lakes , children 's play areas , and the Vancouver Aquarium , among many other attractions .
On June 18 , 2014 , Stanley Park was named `` top park in the entire world '' by TripAdvisor .
