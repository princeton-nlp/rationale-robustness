In the early 1980s , Disney considered adapting the film as a blend of traditionally animated characters and computer-generated environments , but development did not go past a test film to see how the animation hybridizing would result .
In 2001 , Universal Studios acquired rights to the book 's adaptation and initially attempted to develop a computer-animated adaptation with Disney animator Eric Goldberg , but the CGI concept was replaced with a live-action one in 2003 , and Goldberg was dropped for Spike Jonze .
