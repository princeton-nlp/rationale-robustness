A boycott is an act of voluntary and intentional abstention from using , buying , or dealing with a person , organization , or country as an expression of protest , usually for social , political , or environmental reasons .
The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target , or to indicate a moral outrage , to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior .
Sometimes , a boycott can be a form of consumer activism , sometimes called moral purchasing .
When a similar practice is legislated by a national government , it is known as a sanction .
