Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London .
They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music .
Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics , sonic experimentation , extended compositions and elaborate live shows , they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music .
Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals , Nick Mason on drums , Roger Waters on bass and vocals , and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals .
They gained popularity performing in London 's underground music scene during the late 1960s , and under Barrett 's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn -LRB- 1967 -RRB- .
Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967 ; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health .
Waters became the band 's primary lyricist and conceptual leader , devising the concepts behind their albums The Dark Side of the Moon -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , Wish You Were Here -LRB- 1975 -RRB- , Animals -LRB- 1977 -RRB- , The Wall -LRB- 1979 -RRB- and The Final Cut -LRB- 1983 -RRB- .
The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time .
Following creative tensions , Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979 , followed by Waters in 1985 .
Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd ; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and , later , a band member .
The three produced two more albums -- A Momentary Lapse of Reason -LRB- 1987 -RRB- and The Division Bell -LRB- 1994 -RRB- -- and toured through 1994 .
After nearly two decades of acrimony , Gilmour , Wright , and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London as part of the global awareness event Live 8 ; Gilmour and Waters later stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again .
Barrett died in 2006 , and Wright in 2008 .
The final Pink Floyd studio album , The Endless River -LRB- 2014 -RRB- , was recorded without Waters and based largely on unreleased material .
Pink Floyd were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 .
By 2013 , the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide , including 75 million certified units in the United States .
