The Dogs D'Amour are a rock and roll band formed in 1983 in London , England .
Over the years the band has had various line-ups , the only constant being vocalist Tyla .
Their 1989 release , A Graveyard of Empty Bottles , reached # 16 on the UK Albums Chart while the single `` Satellite Kid '' reached # 26 on the UK Singles Chart .
In 1991 , the band broke up onstage , before reforming briefly in the early 1990s for the release of their sixth studio album More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace .
After this , however , the most famous incarnation of the band ceased to exist .
There was another brief reunion in 2000 and an album , but , throughout the 2000s , Tyla has been touring and releasing albums under the band name , which is vastly different from their older material .
In December 2012 the ` classic ' line-up of Tyla , Jo ` Dog ' Almeida , Steve James and Bam agreed to reform to play a series of benefit concerts for their long-time friend , and former bandmate , Paul Hornby .
In January 2013 , the band recorded an EP in Florida and announced live dates for the UK and Spain .
