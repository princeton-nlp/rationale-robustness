The Man in the Iron Mask is a 1998 American action drama film directed , produced , and written by Randall Wallace , and starring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role as the title character and villain , Jeremy Irons as Aramis , John Malkovich as Athos , Gerard Depardieu as Porthos , and Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan .
The picture uses characters from Alexandre Dumas ' D'Artagnan Romances and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne .
The film centers on the aging four musketeers , Athos , Porthos , Aramis , and D'Artagnan , during the reign of King Louis XIV and attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask , using a plot more closely related to the flamboyant 1929 version starring Douglas Fairbanks , The Iron Mask , and the 1939 version directed by James Whale , than the original Dumas book .
Like the 1998 version , the two aforementioned adaptations were also released through United Artists .
