Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s , and is commonly considered a subgenre , though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae .
Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings , usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece , and emphasizing the drum and bass parts -LRB- this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a riddim -RRB- .
Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo , reverb , panoramic delay , and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works .
It was an early form of popular electronic music .
Dub was pioneered by Osbourne `` King Tubby '' Ruddock , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry , Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s .
Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub , and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre .
Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy .
These producers , especially Ruddock and Perry , looked upon the mixing console as an instrument , manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different .
Dub has influenced many genres of music , including rock -LRB- most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk -RRB- , pop , hip hop , disco , and later house , techno , ambient , electronic dance music , and trip hop .
Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived , and some of the originators , such as Lee `` Scratch '' Perry and Mad Professor , continue to produce new material .
