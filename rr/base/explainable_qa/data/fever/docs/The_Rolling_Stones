The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962 .
The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones -LRB- rhythm guitar , harmonica -RRB- , Mick Jagger -LRB- lead vocals -RRB- , Keith Richards -LRB- lead guitar , backing vocals -RRB- , Bill Wyman -LRB- bass -RRB- , Charlie Watts -LRB- drums -RRB- , and Ian Stewart -LRB- piano -RRB- .
Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985 .
Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969 , having already been replaced by Mick Taylor , who remained until 1974 .
After Taylor left the band , Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since .
Following Wyman 's departure in 1993 , Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist .
Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins -LRB- 1967 -- 82 -RRB- , Billy Preston -LRB- through the mid-1970s -RRB- and Chuck Leavell -LRB- 1982-present -RRB- .
The band was first led by Jones , but after teaming as the band 's songwriters , Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles .
The Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964 , and identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s .
Rooted in blues and early rock and roll , the group began a short period of musical experimentation in the mid-1960s that peaked with the psychedelic album Their Satanic Majesties Request -LRB- 1967 -RRB- .
Subsequently , the group returned to its `` bluesy '' roots with Beggars Banquet -LRB- 1968 -RRB- which along with its follow-ups Let It Bleed -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Sticky Fingers -LRB- 1971 -RRB- and Exile on Main St. -LRB- 1972 -RRB- is generally considered to be the band 's best work and is seen as their `` Golden Age '' .
During this period , they were first introduced on stage as `` The World 's Greatest Rock and Roll Band '' .
Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the `` remarkable endurance '' of the Rolling Stones to being `` rooted in traditional verities , in rhythm-and-blues and soul music '' , while `` more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone '' .
The band continued to release commercially successful records in the 1970s and sold many albums , including Some Girls -LRB- 1978 -RRB- and Tattoo You -LRB- 1981 -RRB- , which were their most popular albums worldwide .
From 1983 to 1987 , tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split .
However , they managed to patch up their friendship in 1987 .
They separated temporarily to work on solo projects and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , which was followed by a large stadium and arena tour .
Since the 1990s , new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent .
Despite this , the Rolling Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit , with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s .
By 2007 , the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time : Voodoo Lounge Tour -LRB- 1994 -- 95 -RRB- , Bridges to Babylon Tour -LRB- 1997 -- 98 -RRB- , Licks Tour -LRB- 2002 -- 03 -RRB- and A Bigger Bang Tour -LRB- 2005 -- 07 -RRB- .
The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004 .
Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' list and their estimated album sales are above 250 million .
They have released 30 studio albums , 18 live albums and numerous compilations .
Let It Bleed -LRB- 1969 -RRB- was their first of five consecutive No. 1 studio and live albums in the UK .
Sticky Fingers -LRB- 1971 -RRB- was the first of eight consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the US .
In 2008 , the band ranked 10th on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart .
In 2012 , the band celebrated its 50th anniversary .
