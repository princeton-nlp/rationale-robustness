The Wire is an American crime drama television series set and produced in Baltimore , Maryland .
Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon , the series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States .
The Wire premiered on June 2 , 2002 , and ended on March 9 , 2008 , comprising 60 episodes over five seasons .
Each season of The Wire introduces a different institution in the city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement , while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons .
In chronological order these are : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , the school system , and the print news media .
The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles , as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles .
Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama , the show is `` really about the American city , and about how we live together .
It 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals .
Whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed . ''
The Wire is lauded for its literary themes , its uncommonly acute exploration of society and politics , and its realistic portrayal of urban life .
Although the show received average ratings throughout its run , and never won any major television awards , it has since come to be regarded by many critics as one of the greatest television series of all time .
