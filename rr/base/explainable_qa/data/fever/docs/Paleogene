The Paleogene -LRB- -LSB- pronˈpæliːədʒiːn -RSB- or -LSB- ˈpeɪliːədʒiːn -RSB- also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene ; informally Lower Tertiary -RRB- is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago -LRB- Mya -RRB- to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya .
It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon .
The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small , simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period .
This period consists of the Paleocene , Eocene and Oligocene epochs .
The end of the Paleocene -LRB- 55.5 / 54.8 Mya -RRB- was marked by the Paleocene -- Eocene Thermal Maximum , one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic , which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic foraminifera and on land , a major turnover in mammals .
The terms ` Paleogene System ' -LRB- formal -RRB- and ` lower Tertiary System ' -LRB- informal -RRB- are applied to the rocks deposited during the ` Paleogene Period ' .
The somewhat confusing terminology seems to be due to attempts to deal with the comparatively fine subdivisions of time possible in the relatively recent geologic past , for which more details are preserved .
By dividing the Tertiary Period into two periods instead of directly into five epochs , the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of ` periods ' of the preceding Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras .
