An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group .
These advantages include an ability to :
hire professional investment managers , which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management ;
benefit from economies of scale , i.e. , lower transaction costs ;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk .
Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools , collective investment vehicles , collective investment schemes , managed funds , or simply funds .
The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities , or short collective investment undertaking -LRB- cf. Law -RRB- .
An investment fund may be held by the public , such as a mutual fund , exchange-traded fund , special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund , or it may be sold only in a private placement , such as a hedge fund or private equity fund .
The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds , which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts .
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions -LRB- e.g. , emerging markets or Europe -RRB- or specified industry sectors -LRB- e.g. , technology -RRB- .
Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity , and the lack of currency risk .
Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims , their past investment performance , and other factors such as fees .
