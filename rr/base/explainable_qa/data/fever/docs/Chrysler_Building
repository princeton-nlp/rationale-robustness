The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco-style skyscraper located on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City , at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in the Turtle Bay neighborhood .
At 318.9 m , the structure was the world 's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931 .
It is the tallest brick building in the world , with a steel structure .
After the destruction of the World Trade Center , it was again the second-tallest building in New York City until December 2007 , when the spire was raised onto the 1,200-foot -LRB- 365.8 m -RRB- Bank of America Tower , making the Chrysler building the third tallest building in New York .
In addition , The New York Times Building , which opened in 2007 , is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height .
Both buildings were then demoted to fourth tallest building in the city , when the under-construction One World Trade Center surpassed their height , and then to fifth position by 432 Park Avenue , which was completed in 2015 .
The Chrysler Building is a classic example of Art Deco architecture and considered by many contemporary architects to be one of the finest buildings in New York City .
In 2007 , it was ranked ninth on the List of America 's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects .
It was the headquarters of the Chrysler Corporation from 1930 until the mid-1950s .
Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer , the corporation did not pay for the construction of it and never owned it , as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself , so that his children could inherit it .
