British Airways -LRB- BA -RRB- is the largest airline in the United Kingdom based on fleet size , or the second largest , behind easyJet , when measured by passengers carried .
The airline is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport .
In January 2011 BA merged with Iberia , creating the International Airlines Group -LRB- IAG -RRB- , a holding company registered in Madrid , Spain .
IAG is the world 's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe .
It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and in the FTSE 100 Index .
BA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations , British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways , and two regional airlines , Cambrian Airways from Cardiff , and Northeast Airlines from Newcastle upon Tyne .
On 31 March 1974 , all four companies were merged to form British Airways .
After almost 13 years as a state company , BA was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the Conservative government .
The carrier expanded with the acquisition of British Caledonian in 1987 , Dan-Air in 1992 , and British Midland International in 2012 .
A long-time Boeing customer , BA ordered 59 Airbus A320 family aircraft in August 1998 .
In 2007 it purchased 12 Airbus A380s and 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners , marking the start of its long-haul fleet replacement .
The centrepiece of the airline 's long-haul fleet is the Boeing 777 , with 58 in the fleet .
BA is the largest operator of the Boeing 747-400 , with 41 registered to the airline .
It is a founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance , along with American Airlines , Cathay Pacific , Qantas , and the now defunct Canadian Airlines .
The alliance has since grown to become the third largest , after SkyTeam and Star Alliance .
