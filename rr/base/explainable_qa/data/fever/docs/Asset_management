Asset management , broadly defined , refers to any system that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or group .
It may apply to both tangible assets -LRB- such as buildings -RRB- and to intangible assets such as human capital , intellectual property , goodwill and/or financial assets -RRB- .
Asset management is a systematic process of deploying , operating , maintaining , upgrading , and disposing of assets cost-effectively .
