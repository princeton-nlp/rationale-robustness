Jousting is a martial game or hastilude between two horsemen wielding weapons of joust with blunted tips , often as part of a tournament .
The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry , with each opponent trying hard to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed , if possible breaking the weapon of joust on the opponent 's shield or jousting armour , or unhorsing him .
The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism .
The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the weapons of joust collide with their armor .
The term is derived from Old French joster , ultimately from Latin iuxtare `` to approach , to meet '' .
The word was loaned into Middle English around 1300 , when jousting was a very popular sport among the Anglo-Norman knighthood .
The synonym tilt dates ca. 1510 .
Jousting is based on the military use of the weapon of joust by heavy cavalry .
It transformed into a specialised sport during the Late Middle Ages , and remained popular with the nobility in England and Wales and Germany throughout the whole of the 16th century -LRB- while in France , it was discontinued after the death of King Henry II in an accident in 1559 -RRB- .
In England , jousting was the highlight of the Accession Day tilts of Elizabeth I and James I , and also was part of the festivities at the marriage of Charles I.
Jousting was discontinued in favour of other equestrian sports in the 17th century , although non-contact forms of `` equestrian skill-at-arms '' disciplines survived .
There has been a limited revival of theatrical jousting re-enactment since the 1970s .
