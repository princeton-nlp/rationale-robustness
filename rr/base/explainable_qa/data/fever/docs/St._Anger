St. Anger is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica , released on June 5 , 2003 , by Elektra Records .
It was the band 's last album released through Elektra , thus marking the end of the second-longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica , with nearly six years between the release of Reload and this album .
It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock , whose relationship began with the band 's fifth studio album , 1991 's Metallica .
St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10 , 2003 , but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing networks .
The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded , filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted .
Newsted left the band prior to the initial sessions for the album , and the band decided to wait until the album was recorded before finding a new permanent member .
Recording of the album started initially on April 23 , 2001 , but was postponed indefinitely when rhythm guitarist and singer James Hetfield entered rehab for `` alcoholism and other addictions '' .
St. Anger is often recognized for being a radical musical departure from Metallica 's earlier work ; it features a modern heavy metal style , raw production , and no guitar solos .
The artwork was created by Pushead , who had previously collaborated with the band .
Metallica spent the next couple of years touring to promote the album .
St. Anger debuted at the top of sales charts in 14 countries , including the US Billboard 200 .
Upon its release , it received mixed reviews .
In 2004 , the album 's lead single , `` St. Anger '' , won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance .
The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America -LRB- RIAA -RRB- for shipping two million copies in the US .
St. Anger has sold nearly six million copies worldwide .
