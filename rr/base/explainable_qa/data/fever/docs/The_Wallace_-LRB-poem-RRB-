The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace , also known as The Wallace , is a long `` romantic biographical '' poem by the fifteenth-century Scottish makar of the name Blind Harry probably at some time in the decade before 1488 .
As the title suggests , it commemorates and eulogises the life and actions of the Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace who lived a century and a half earlier .
The poem is historically inaccurate , and mentions several events that never happened .
For several hundred years following its publication , The Wallace was the second most popular book in Scotland after the Bible .
The earliest extant text is a copy made by John Ramsay , 1st Lord Bothwell in 1488 , but that copy has no title page and last few pages are missing , with no mention of Blind Harry as its author .
The first mention of Blind Harry as the work 's author was made by John Mair in his 1521 work Historia Majoris Britanniae , tam Angliae quam Scotiae .
It was later republished in the late 18th century by the poet William Hamilton , in contemporary English .
This version also went through over 20 editions , with the last published in 1859 .
